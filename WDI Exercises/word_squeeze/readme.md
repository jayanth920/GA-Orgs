# Squeeze

Write a javascript function `squeeze` that takes a string as an argument and returns a the same string with consecutive duplicate letters removed.

## Examples:

* banana => banana
* shmeeeeeee! => shme!
* yabba dabba doo => yaba daba do
* AW-WEE-OO KILLER TOFU => AW-WE-O KILER TOFU

## Bonus

* If you used iteration over the string, try doing it without a loop (hint: look at regular expressions).
  * If you used regular expressions, try doing it without them.
* Have the function return an array containing the squeezed word, and then the remaining elements are the letters removed.
