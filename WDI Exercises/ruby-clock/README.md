- **Author**: Colin Hart (@ColinTheRobot); adapted by Jason Seminara (@jasonseminara). 
- **Description**: A pseudo-clock that ticks off seconds forever.
- **Date**: 2016-03-24

##Prompt
Build a clock using only strings and loops.
- Only use the Time class to initially set the clock to the current time.
- This should print the current time out to the screen once every second, 
and print an alarm at the requested time
- Time fragments must be zero-padded properly.

**BONUS**: figure out how to actually make an audible buzz or ding for the alarm.
