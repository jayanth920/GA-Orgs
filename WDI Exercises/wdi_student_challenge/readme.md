# WDI Student Challenge

**We're so excited** that you're interested in WDI! A lot of ground gets covered over the course of the 12-week class. To be set up for success it's vital to know the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

To this end, we've prepared your first WDI assignment! 

Please e-mail the WDI Producer a link to your completed code within 72 hours.

## Goal 1

Create an "About Me" page from scratch -- that is, by writing your own HTML and CSS, rather than using Wix or Squarespace. Your page should incorporate both HTML and CSS. Please include a picture, and at least 100 words telling us a bit about yourself.

Make your site available online so that someone somewhere else can enter your site's address in their browser's URL bar and see what you made! If you wish, [BitBalloon](https://www.bitballoon.com/) will host your site for free.

## Goal 2

Complete as many of the following sub-goals as you can. Hint: you'll need Javascript!

1. When your webpage loads, it displays an alert box that says "Welcome to my site!"
- When your webpage loads, it prompts the visitor for their name, and then displays "Welcome to my site, [their name]!"
- Add a "Greet Me" button to your page that, when clicked, prompts the visitor for their name and then displays "Welcome to my site, [their name]!"
- When the button is clicked, the visitor is prompted for their name, then for a number. Then, the "Welcome" message is displayed a number of times equal to the number they entered.
- If the visitor enters a number less than 0 or greater than 5, instead of the "Welcome" message they are alerted that their input was incorrect.
- If the visitor enters a number less than 0 or greater than 5, or something that is *not* a number, they are alerted that their input was incorrect.
- If the visitor enters a number less than 0 or greater than 5, or something that is not a number, they are prompted to try again and prompted for a number. The process repeats until they enter correct input.
- The visitor has the option to "quit", which redirects their browser to http://generalassemb.ly
- Instead of the "Welcome" message being displayed as an alert, it is displayed as text on the webpage itself.
