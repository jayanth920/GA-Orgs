# Relaxation!

It's been an intense two and a half weeks of lessons, and we've learned so much... ruby, sinatra, dbs, rails, etc.

## Your Goal

This weekend, we recommend that you spend 24 hours away from coding. Ride a bike, take a walk, play a board game, call an old friend, or watch a movie!

## Submission

Open an issue on this repo, and just tell us what you did.
