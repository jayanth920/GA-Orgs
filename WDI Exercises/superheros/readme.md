# Superheros

## The base class

- Create a `Person` class
- a `Person` has a name and an age
- create a `to_s` method that prints out the person's name and age.

## The sub class

- Create a `Superhero` class that inherits from `Person`
- Override the initialize method to accept a name, age *and* superpower
- Override the `to_s` method to include the person's superpower
