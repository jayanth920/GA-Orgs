## Javascript Calculator

Your task is to create Javascript functions that represents calculator actions. Such functions should include
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Exponents (Hint: Look up Javascript's Math object)
- An operation of your choice!

> You should be able to run these functions by passing in two arguments and receiving a return value!  

### Bonus 1

**DO NOT** attempt the bonuses until you have completed the next two exercises in the [Functions Fundamentals repo](https://github.com/ga-wdi-lessons/function-fundamentals).  

Create a Javascript object that represents a calculator. It should have methods that provide it with the following functionality...

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Exponents (Hint: Look up Javascript's Math object)
- An operation of your choice!

> You should be able to run these methods like so from your browser's Javascript console...  

```js
calculator.add(1,2);
// => 3
```

### Bonus 2

Give your calculator memory and allow it to persist the result of multiple operations. Store this result in a value property.  

**Example:** running `calculator.add(1,2)`, `calculator.add(3,2)` and `calculator.mutliply(5,2)` in sequence would result in a value of 10. In this example, the first argument for each method call represents the running value.
Give your calculator a clear method that resets value.
