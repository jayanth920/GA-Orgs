# Fun with APIs

Your prompt is an open-ended one: make something cool using a 3rd party API! There's no need to create a back-end for this assignment -- just stick to HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Not sure where to start? Here is a suggested workflow...
  1. **Set up your HTML and CSS.** Figure out what you want your app to look like.
  2. **Set up Javascript that works with dummy data.** Hard-code some fake data so you can nail down how you want Javascript to render data on the webpage.
  3. **Create your AJAX call.** Just make sure it's working -- don't worry about handling the response yet.
  4. **Extract information from your response.** How do you go about accessing it?
  5. **Handle API Response.** What are you going to do with the API response? How will you render it in your HTML/CSS?
  6. **AJAX error handling.** What will your program do when your API call doesn't work?

## APIs you may (but don't have to) use...

* [Giphy](https://api.giphy.com/)
* [OMDB (Open Movie Database)](http://www.omdbapi.com/)
* [Soundcloud](https://developers.soundcloud.com)
* [Weather Underground](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api)

These are much more ambitious because they require authentication:

* [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/)
* [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview)

There's an API for pretty much everything. You can search for more at [Mashape](https://www.mashape.com/explore).

**If you find yourself spending more than 30 minutes just getting the API to talk back to you, you're spending too much time.** Use one of the prompts from this next section:
