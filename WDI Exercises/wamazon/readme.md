# Wamazon

JANcorp is getting a platform together that's going to blow Amazon out of the water. We just need a couple of front end engineers to develop our page that will display items. The only problem is all of our data is in this one `amazonProducts.js` file. And we only sell 7 things.. BUT we have BIG ideas. We just need to get started. So what we want from you is to handroll some sick object oriented javascript and display these 7 things super stylishly.

## Objectives
Your objective is to create a web page that displays each products title, description, image, price, and rating.

You'll notice that there is only 1 file in this repo that contains the data. Here are some things you'll need to make or do to get this working:

- A class for a product
- A class for a product view
- a script file that puts it all together!
- an html file that loads your JS files

Reference [this lesson](https://github.com/ga-wdi-lessons/js-view-constructors) should you need any assitance.
