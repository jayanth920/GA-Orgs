# Backbone Tutorial HW

## Assignment

For this homework, you should:

1. Pick a tutorial on backbone. Any is fine, but we have some suggested ones below.
2. Work through the tutorial. Try to time box yourself to 2 hours, maybe 3 max.
3. Submit your code as a PR on this repo.
4. Please include your thoughts / observations / what you learned in the description of the pull request.


## Timebox

Please consider timeboxing your efforts to 2 - 3 hours max! 

## Suggested Tutorials

Note: Some of these tutorials will do things a bit differently than we did in class. This is *normal* and *ok*! Backbone is a flexible framework, so there are many patterns and ways to do things. As you're working through a tutorial, think about why they might be doing things differently.
