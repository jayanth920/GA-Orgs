### Exercise: Getting familiar

We are going to use the Learn Ruby section of TestFirst.org to practice reading and writing specifications.

You will be cloning a repo and following a series of instructions.  Follow their instructions carefully, if you think you are lost, re-read the instructions, I expect you missed a step.

These exercises increase in complexity.  They will exercise your Ruby knowledge and your RSpec knowledge at the same time.  If you ever find yourself getting ahead, feel free to do any of these exercises.  Conversely, if you feel a little lost, back up.  Do some of the exercises we skipped.

Let's start at the very beginning.  What a very fine place to start.

1. Read through the [philosophy behind TestFirst.org](http://testfirst.org/about).
2. Continue in with the exercises.  Timebox yourself to 2 hours.
3. We recommend:
- 00 Hello
- 01 Temperature
- 02 Calculator
- 03 Simon Says
- 08 Book Titles
- 10 Temperature Object

Feel free to do whichever exercises seem relevant (and fun!) to you.
