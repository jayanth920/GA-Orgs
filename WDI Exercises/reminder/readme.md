# Reminders!


## Part 1
### Setup
- Create a main `index.html` for our backbone application
- Install BB dependencies using Bower.
- Create files neccessary for creating model and collection definitions for `Posts`

### Models and Collections!
- Create Backbone model and collection definitions for `Posts`

In the console:
- Create at least 5 instances of the `Post` backbone model
- use setter methods on the instances you created to set a new attribute
- play with getter methods to get attributes of a backbone instance you created
- Create a `Posts` collection that contains some of the 5 instances you created earlier
- use methods on a collection to add or set instances of the backbone model to your collection

### Bonus
- Use your posts' models and collections to generate some views!

## Part 2
### Setup
- Fork/clone the [reminders_rails_api](https://github.com/ga-dc/reminder_rails_api)
- 
> Note this is explicitly only serving as the backend api endpoint. Continue to use your `index.html` and dependencies there.

### Add urls
- add urls to your model and collection definitions

In the console:
- save a backbone object to your database
- update that object and save to see the updates in your database
- create an object in your database through a collection
- update an existing object in your database and save it

### Bonus
- Use your posts and collections to genereate some views!
- Sit your backbone on top of the Rails application instead of your `index.html`
