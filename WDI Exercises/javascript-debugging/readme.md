# Javascript Debugging

The enclosed `app.js` has some pretty ugly code. We want to get it to run!

This code uses some concepts that you haven't seen yet. However, it still follows the same rules as all the Javascript we've seen so far, and so you can debug it the same way.

Use your debugging skills to make the script output the following in your browser's console:

```
[Log] Starting              (app.js, line 63)
[Log] inside function1      (app.js, line 55)
[Log] inside function2      (app.js, line 50)
[Log] inside function3      (app.js, line 38)
[Log] inside function4      (app.js, line 42)
[Log] inside function5      (app.js, line 24)
[Log] inside function6      (app.js, line 29)
[Log] inside function7      (app.js, line 19)
[Log] inside function8      (app.js, line 10)
[Log] inside function9      (app.js, line 4)
[Log] The end               (app.js, line 5)
```
