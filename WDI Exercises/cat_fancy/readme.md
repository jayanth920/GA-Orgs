# Cat Fancy

Adam made this website to show off his favorite cat photos. It's a pretty great website, but it could be *even better*.

The HTML and the bulk of the CSS has been provided for you. Your task is to change `EDIT_ME.css` and `index.html` so that:

- When clicking on one of the CATegories at the top of the page, only those cats are shown.
- The "Rate these cats!" section to the top-right becomes a drop-down menu, in which only one of the three options is shown at a time.
    - You should *not* use the `<select>` tag because it cannot be styled. Use radio buttons instead.

**Input elements do NOT need to go in a `<form>` tag!** If we were to actually be submitting information with this site we'd probably need a `<form>`, but it's not necessary in this case.

## CSS selectors that will be useful

```
:target
:checked
element1 + element2
```
