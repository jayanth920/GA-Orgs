# Portfolio Site

This lab is for you to start working on your portfolio site. Your portfolio site is an important part of your personal brand and any job applications you send out. It'll often the first thing hiring managers look at in your application. So it's pretty important to have a clean and professional looking portfolio site!

Start by reading through the following:
- [Building A Portfolio Site](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/building-a-portfolio-site)
- [15 Web Developer Portfolios to Inspire You](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/15-web-developer-portfolios-to-inspire-you-137fb1743cae)
- [10 Awesome Web Developer Portfolios](https://codeburst.io/10-awesome-web-developer-portfolios-d266b32e6154)

Once you've finished, go ahead and get started researching, planning and building your portfolio site. You are free to build off of the portfolio site you started in Week 1 or scrap it and start from scratch!

A link to your deployed and final portfolio site with your name, resume, and links to your WDI projects is due before the last day of class to your squad leader!

## Submission

For this lab, submit an issue on this repository with the following:

- 3 or more portfolio sites you'd like to model yours off of
- A list of what you'll include in the MVP version

Once you've finished that, go ahead and get building!
