# Welcome to the API for Grumblr

When starting out, you will just see a rails app like you've seen in the past couple of weeks at `http://locahost:3000`. We will configure this to be a fully-fledged Rails API. For reference, solution code is available on the `api-solution` branch.

## Setup

Clone down this repo. **Don't forget to check out the api-starter branch (2nd Step)**

```
$ cd grumblr_rails_api
$ git checkout api-starter
$ bundle install
$ rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
$ rails s
```
