# 'Murica!

## A CSS exercize

**Without touching `flag.html`**, touching only `flag.css`, and without using any images, make the content of `flag.html` look like the American flag in your browser! I managed to do it with only 3 selectors and 4 properties.

Bonus: Make the blue part of the flag have 50 white stars!
