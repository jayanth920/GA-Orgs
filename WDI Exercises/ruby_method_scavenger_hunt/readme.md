Building Ruby Familiarity

In this exercise you will take a first look at some common commands in Ruby.
The idea here is to build your comfort level with basic Ruby syntax and
working in the console/pry.

NOTE: Some of this will be review from the pre-work; some won't.
Just type them in and see the displayed output.

Steps:
  1. Open up a new terminal window
  2. Launch pry
  3. Paste a line of code into pry
  4. Press return
  5. **Examine the displayed output and try to make sense of what the code did.**
  6. Repeat steps 3-5 for all lines below in order
