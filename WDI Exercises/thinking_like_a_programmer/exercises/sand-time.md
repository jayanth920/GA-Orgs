# Sand Time

You have two sand timers with you. One can measure 7 minutes and the other sand timer can measure 11 minutes. This means that, for your sand timer that can measure 7 minutes, it takes 7 minutes for the sand timer to completely empty the sand from one portion to the other. Similarly, for your sand timer that can measure 11 minutes, it takes 11 minutes for the sand timer to completely empty the sand from one portion to the other.

How can you measure 15 minutes using both timers?
