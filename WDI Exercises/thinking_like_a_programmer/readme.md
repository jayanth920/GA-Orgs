# Thinking like a Programmer

This exercise will get you primed to start thinking like a programmer! What does it mean to think like a programmer? Well, being a programmer means taking complex problems, breaking them down in to smaller parts, then writing code to solve each small part. Thinking like a programmer is that process: taking a problem, breaking it down into smaller parts, then solving each part to assemble a final solution.

Before continuing to the exercises below, read through [this article](https://zellwk.com/blog/think/) on thinking like a programmer! When you finish reading the article, turn to neighbor and discuss the following:

* Why do we need to break a problem down in to smaller problems?
* How do we take a problem and identify the smaller problems we need to solve?
* Once we've solved our smaller problems are we finished? What might come next?
* What might a list of steps be for approaching a problem? (hint: write them down!)


## Exercises:

There are 4 exercises we've prepared to help you practice thinking like a programmer. The goal for these exercises is not to get an answer, or even to get the correct answer. The goal is to practice taking a problem, breaking it down, solving the smaller problems and then refactoring our solution (i.e. following the steps you wrote down from the fourth question above).
