# Code Wars Challenges

Below are two code challenges borrowed from [Codewars](http://codewars.com/), a site built by developers at a hack-a-thon, that can be very useful in exposing you to varied exercises across different languages and techniques for solving them. Codewars provides built-in testing, solutions, and rankings for developers looking to get reps in and "level up". It is a great resource for staying on top of your current skills and learning new ones as you grow as a developer.

For the exercises below, follow the link and use the testing suite to validate your code. If you finish the first one with time to spare, move on to the second.
