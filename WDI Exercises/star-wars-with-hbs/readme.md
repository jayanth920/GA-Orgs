# Star bars! ... Handlebars with Star Wars Characters!

Included in this repo is `undry.html`. Open it in the browser to checkout what your end result should be.

Utilize handlebars in the `index.html` to render the same html as the `undry.html`.

> Don't forget to include handlebar dependancies and the `script.js`

In the `script.js`, there is an object that contains the same star wars characters as the `undry.html`. Create a handlebars template in the `index.html`. Then pass objects to that template in the `script.js`.

First, see if you can do just one of the characters.

If you're feeling up to it, loop through all the characters and render the template for each one.
