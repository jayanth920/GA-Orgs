# Fibonacci Sequence

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

You may do your work in a JavaScript file and run it in the command line or include it in an html file and see the output in the console in your browser.

**Tips:**
- think through the problem before you start coding
- break the problem into as many parts as you can, solve each individually
- get something that works, then get something that works well. Don't skip either step.
- solve for the information you have (i.e. if you can solve it for 10, you have it for 4 million)
