# Diy plugins


Use the [jQuery plugin docs](http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/) and this [plugin tutorial](http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/) to greenify the div and update the links, on index.html, to show their "location".

We've setup the page, linked to the js and css, and started on `greenify`.

0.  Fork & clone.
1. See where we stand.
  ```
  $ open index.html
  ```
2. Review the code.  What's happening here?
  - Hey!  That's not green!?!  
  - Sure enough.  You caught us.
3. Now read the docs listed above.
