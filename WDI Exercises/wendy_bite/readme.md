# Wendy Bite

Your client, Wendy, has created "pixel-perfect" images representing how she wants her website to look, and provided the text. Make her site!

Create a file called `style.css` in the root directory.

You only need to work on the "About Me" page. You can reference the included `WendyBite_AboutMe.png` file for design.

### CSS Validation

She knows a thing or two about web design, so be sure your HTML and CSS validate.

To check whether your CSS validates, the instructors will be using this site:

https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input

### Note

You will notice that certain characters do not render properly. For example, this appears in the header: `RÃ©sumÃ©`. You need to fix this. Start by Googling "strange HTML characters".

### Bonus

Create and style the resume page for Wendy's site. You can reference the included `WendyBite_Resume.png` file for design.
