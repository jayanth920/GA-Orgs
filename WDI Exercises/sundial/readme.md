# Clock Hands: TDD Edition

Write a function that given the time of the day in hours and minutes returns the angle between the hands on a clock.

**You must take a TDD approach to this assignment.** Create a test before writing the corresponding code.
* You must implement at least three different tests.
* Think about the different cases your function will need to handle. Create a test for each of them.

### Notes:
* It should give a positive angle and return the smaller one (ie less than 180 degrees).
* You can assume that the clock only moves once each minute on the minute to update its hands.
