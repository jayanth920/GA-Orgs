## Introduction to Handlebars

Today I'm going to talk to you about **Handlebars.js**! This is one of *many* Javascript template frameworks available to work with.

I'm here to talk about it because I find that it is great for use in production, has an easy-to-learn syntax, and doesn't require a lot of work to get up and running with it.
