## Now, let's render some data

To render our template with data, you can pass in a data object because each compiled template is a function!


```javascript
Handlebars.templates['aboutMe.hbs']({
  name: "James",
  colour: "purple",
  restaurant: "Arami"
});
```

That's it! You can now use this template to populate various DOM elements with dynamic data.
