## Let's test our template Now

We're going to fire up our simple express app:

`node app.js`

Now, let's view our page in the browser:

`localhost:3000`

In the console, let's test our template!

```javascript
Handlebars.templates['aboutMe.hbs']();
```

See the result?

```html
<article>
Hi, my name is ! My favourite colour is  and I enjoy eating at !
</article>
```
