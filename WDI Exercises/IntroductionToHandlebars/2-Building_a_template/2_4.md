## Time to compile our template

As noted earlier, one of the **primary** advantages of using Handlebars templates is the ability to use precompiled templates. This allows us to quickly render our templates without the bulk of the entire framework. This will require jumping into the *Node CLI*.

We'll navigate to our project folder. I've placed my template inside of `/example/Templates/aboutMe.hbs`.

To compile this template, I'll navigate to `/example`.
