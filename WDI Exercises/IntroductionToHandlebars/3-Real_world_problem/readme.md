## Real World problem

Wouldn't it be nice to have input boxes that can toggle back and forth between an **edit** mode and a **read-only** mode? This could be beneficial given user permissions, an offline version of an app using Local Storage, or just switching between CRUD operations on a data object.

We're going to to create form input elements that could toggle from interactive to read-only.

Using precompiled Handlebars templates, we can use a model-template design pattern to achieve this.
