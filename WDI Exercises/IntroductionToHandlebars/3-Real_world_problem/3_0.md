## Let's identify the problem

We have a few input boxes in our application. They look like:

```html
<input type="text" placeholder="Your name?">
<input type="number" placeholder="Your age?">
<input type="email" placeholder="you@domain.com">
```

Now, it'd be nice if we could disable user input for various reasons (we can be creative here). In our case, we want to disable user input once a user has submitted this information.
