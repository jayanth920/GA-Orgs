# Grumblr in Angular with Built-it directives

Build the Grumblr app described in the "you do" sections of the [Angular Intro, Controllers, and Directives lesson](https://github.com/ga-dc/curriculum/tree/master/10-angular/introduction_to_angular). That is showing, adding, editing, and deleting grumbls. If you complete all of the features described, add more! There will have been time in class to complete most of this assignment. Use this as a base to continue exploring Angular. If you didn't over the weekend, check out [Code School's Shaping up with Angular.js](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js). If you're very comfortable with what we've covered so far, look into Angular's [PhoneCat Tutorial App](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial). If you find other Angular resources you like, submit issues on this repo with links!

By Wednesday morning, 9am submit at PR against this repo with your implementation of Grumblr.
