# MEAN Hackathon - Part 1

## Objectives

* Use prior concepts like RESTful endpoints, JWT tokens, and MongoDB to solve a problem
* Create a functioning API with a team

This is part 1 of a two-part, day-long hackathon. Winners will be rewarded hansomely at the discretion of the instructional staff.

## Theme

Your theme for this hackathon will be given to you by your instructors.

* Create a RESTful API that uses the following technologies:
  * Node.js
  * Express
  * MongoDB
  * Mongoose
* You must create at least two models (embedded documents count)
* JWT authentication is optional, but great if you want to protect your endpoints.
* You must deploy to Heroku sometime today. However, you can do so in the afternoon if you run out of time (Hint: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/mongolab#adding-mongolab-as-a-heroku-add-on)
* You may work in groups of 2-4 people (use git)
* Test using Postman or another client
* Feel free to data scrape or find other ways to populate the database for your API.
* Note that there is a lot to do: teamwork is key

# MEAN Hackathon - Part 2

## Objectives

* Utilize the API from this morning by making an Angular client
* Create a functioning app with a backend API and frontend MVC client
* Deploy an API server to Heroku

## Continuing from earlier...

Now that you have a MVP for your API, add onto it by creating an Angular app to consume it

* Create an Angular app the utilizes the API you made. Keep in mind the setup you'll need to perform:
  * Creating a folder for static files
  * Serving a single page with all the static files
  * Redirecting endpoints that aren't API endpoints to the single page app
* You must create at least two different frontend routes
  * One can be an About page
* REMINDER: You must deploy to Heroku sometime today (Hint: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/mongolab#adding-mongolab-as-a-heroku-add-on)
