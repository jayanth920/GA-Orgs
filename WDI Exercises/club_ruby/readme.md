# Club Ruby

As the new manager of Club Ruby, you been tasked with creating an automated bouncing system.

The club's rules state:

- Only people 18 and over are allowed in the door
- No more than 8 people should be inside the club at any time

Using what you know about loops and collections in Ruby, write a script that when given an array of people waiting *outside* the club...:

- Creates a new array of people *inside* the club
- Allows the appropriate people into the club
- Stops once 8 people have been admitted

Some sample people have been provided for you in `script.rb`.

#### Hint

- How could you use `next` and `break` to alter the behavior of a loop?

## Bonuses

1. Determine whether or not a person can be served alcohol (that is: whether they're 21 or over)
1. Create a new key/value pair for each `person` with `served` as a boolean
1. Create an array for all people rejected from the club for being too young to enter
