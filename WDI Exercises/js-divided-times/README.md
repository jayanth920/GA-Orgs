## Setup

1. Fork and clone repo locally
2. Move into the project's working directory, and open it up in atom.
3. View the completed solution by running `$ open obfuscated-solution/index.html` to open the page in the browser
3. Look through the starter code and open up the `index.html` in the `starter-code` directory in your browser
4. Edit the js file in `js/main.js` to complete the exercise.

## Getting Started

To start, view the obfuscated code to see how the application works. Then, use jQuery to recreate the functionality. Below we've listed the jQuery functions needed to accomplish the task.

Begin by writing pseudo-code for the website, and then start coding!

> **Note**: You should not need to alter the `HTML`, but feel free to edit the `CSS` for this assignment.
