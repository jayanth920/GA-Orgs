# Resource Bank

Hello WDI instructors!

We have collaborated with several markets to create
a globally-accessible resource bank of both exercises and lessons.

## Getting Started

If you're not yet a member of either of these organizations on github:

- https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/
- https://github.com/ga-wdi-lessons/

You can auto-add yourself as a member by logging in here: http://invite-to-github.wdidc.org/
with a General Assembly email address

## Contributing

### Creating new Resources

You can create as many repos as you want! We've been doing one repo per lesson
and one per exercise with great success.

We recommend using a naming convention like `language-concept-prerequisite`, like
`js-ajax-jquery-first`.

Each repository can be easily searched by tags with [RepoTagger](https://github.com/repotagger/repotagger.github.io) (which can be used with any Github organization or user).

Check the following links for an example:

- http://repotagger.github.io/?name=ga-wdi-exercises
- http://repotagger.github.io/?name=ga-wdi-lessons

You can tag a repo by adding a comma-separated list of tags in the repository's
description, like this: `[tag-one, tag-two, tag-three]`

### Editing existing Resources

You're welcome to make changes to existing lesson plans! Please just make a pull
request and the original creator can merge it in.

If you're going to modify the lesson plan heavily (maybe because the prerequisites have changed),
please just create a new repository!

## Styleguide

### Exercises

Every exercise should have a readme with student set-up instructions.

Starter code lives in the master branch so students can get set up quickly with
a `git clone`.

Solution code is usually in a solution branch, but may have many different branches
depending on the exercise.

### Lessons

Should contain:

- Learning objectives
- Framing
- Timings for each section
- List of prerequisite material
- Sample quiz questions
