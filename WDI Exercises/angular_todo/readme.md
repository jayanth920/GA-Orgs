# To-Do

Make a to-do app!

It can be as creative or simple as you would like... but we'd recommend simple. (Our solution doesn't even have CSS.) It does **not** need a back-end, nor an API, nor any sort of data persistence.

Here are some things the instructors have written that may be helpful:

- [Angular vs Rails](https://github.com/ga-wdi-lessons/angular_spa_intro/blob/master/readme.md#comparison-to-rails)
