# The Tech Interview

Sometime during almost every interview process you will find yourself the subject of a technical interview.  The hiring manager and a few developers gather round the whiteboard and pepper you with questions.  It can be laid back.  It can be intense.  But... it's always draining.

The Tech Interview's dirty little secret...

> They don't expect you to answer _everything_.

Some are even designed so that it is highly unlikely for you to be able to answer everything.  Some groups will even ramp up the complexity to push you.

The bottom line... it's important to practice.  It's important to practice answering questions.  It's important to practice answering questions you may not have the answer to.


## We Do: Demonstration

Instructor demonstrates how they would respond to a technical interview question.  


## Your turn: Practice in groups

```
# (pseudo coded) Instructions
students.each do |student|
  problem = InterviewProblem.all.sample
  student.discuss_intelligently_for_five_minutes(problem)
end
```
### tl;dr

- Pick a random problem from [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com) or [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives)
- Rotate every 5 minutes

### Practice

- Practice thinking out loud.
- Practice diagramming concepts and showing your work
- Practice working through a problem you can't answer, without showing (high levels of) frustration.


## Remember... we do NOT expect you to "complete" the problem
