# Create a WDI exercise

**Write an exercise** for a future WDI student learning pseudo-selectors:

1. Create a "hook". What's the scenario? Maybe a shopkeeper in Legend of Zelda needs a website? Maybe the student has been tasked with refactoring the code for a crusty old Geocities page and making it HTML5/CSS3-compliant?
- Create starter code. This should be enough that students have an idea of where to start. If there's a lot of "busywork" that they need to do (e.g. doing `npm init` or `bower install bootstrap-sass`) maybe do that for them.
- Create a `readme.md` file. Anticipate questions students may have about the prompt and try to address those.
- Push it to **your** Github. Share your exercise with `/r/web_design` or `/r/programming`!
