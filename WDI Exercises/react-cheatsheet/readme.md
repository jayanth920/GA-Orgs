# React Cheatsheet

Building yourself a cheat sheet is a great way of learning new things and reviewing the things you've learned. The beauty of it is, the cheat sheet is entirely yours! You decide what goes in the cheat sheet and how to fill it out.

For this lab, you'll create a cheat sheet for the React material we've covered so far. Your cheat sheet should be a collection of markdown files in a repository with a `readme.md`.

## Requirements

### Working Requirements

Your submission should include all of the following:

- A new repo under your GitHub (not GitHub Enterprise) account
- A `readme.md` file with a header and markdown table with links to each additional markdown file in the repository
- A markdown file for at least 3 of the following:
  - [Components](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/react-intro)
  - [State & Props](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/react-state-and-props)
  - [Reusable Components](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/react-reusable-components)
  - [Component Lifecycle](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/react-component-lifecycle)
  - [React Router](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/react-router)
  - [Building a MERN App](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/building-a-mern-app)
- Each markdown file should contain filled with descriptions of key concepts, explanations for how to do common tasks or anything else that you find helpful

### Bonus Requirements

#### Bonus #1

- Add [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

#### Bonus #2

- Add [Testing with Jest](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/testing-in-react-with-jest-enzyme)

#### Bonus #3

- Turn your markdown files into a simple website deployed to GitHub Pages

## Getting Started

Not sure to start or what to include in your cheat sheet? Here are some tips to help:

- **Start with an Outline.** Outline each markdown file with the key points from each lesson.
- **Make a mind map.** [Mind maping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) is a helpful way of getting things out of your brain and onto a page and seeing how things relate to each other.
- **Make it an FAQ.** Think back to the previous week, what questions did you find yourself asking about the material? Add a heading for each question and write your answer to the question below. Alternatively, make each question a markdown [detail](https://gist.github.com/citrusui/07978f14b11adada364ff901e27c7f61)
- **Explain it like I'm 5.** Collect a list of concepts or ideas from each lesson and write out a definition for each as if you were trying to explain the idea to a 5 year old.
- **Make it a tutorial.** Write tutorial-style explanations for common tasks (creating a new component, making AJAX requests inside components, passing state into a component as props, inverse data flow by passing callbacks as props, etc)

Not sure what to put in your cheat sheet? Here are some things to consider:

- **Use lots of code snippets.** Include code snippets for everything!
- **Define the terms.** Be sure to give everything a definition.
- **Explain things in your own words.** Copying descriptions from a lesson or the documentation is not going to be helpful, but explaining things in your own words will be!

## Submission

Your submission is due at the end of this lab period and should meet the [Technical Requirements](#technical-requirements) outlined above. To submit your lab, create an issue on this repository with a link to your cheat sheet repository.

## Plagiarism

Take a moment to re-familiarize yourself with the [plagiarism policy](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DC-WDI/Administrative/blob/master/plagiarism.md), specifically on using work you find online and on work you do with other students.

We give assignments like this to give you the opportunity to review the material in class in a practical manner. By building something using what you've learned in class, you'll be reviewing the material and gaining a deeper understanding of it.

These assignments are similar to those you can expect when applying for a job, either in the form of a take-home coding challenge or an in-person technical interview. So it's important that you put in your best effort now and challenge yourself to do this assignment on your own.

If you are struggling with the material, that's alright! That's why you're here. First, try reviewing the previous lessons and exercises. Go easy on yourself, you're still learning! If you're still struggling after that, come to office hours and ask an instructor for help. They're here to help you!

Don't copy and paste from another source or another student or the solution branch. That's just going to put you at a disadvantage when you're interviewing for a job
