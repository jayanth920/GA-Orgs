## Question 5

**The scenario:** You're starting a new app. You create a local repo and a repo on Github, create a readme file, and put it on Github. Then you run into Juan, who's already done a lot of the work you were planning to do. You want to pull his code down and include it in your repo, and put your combined code up on your Github repo.

All the steps for one way of doing the above have been written below, but in the wrong order. Put them in the correct order.

```
$ touch README.md
$ git push origin master
$ git push origin master
$ git remote add origin git@github.com/username/project-repo.git
$ git remote add juan git@github.com/juan/project-repo.git
$ git commit -m "initial commit"
$ cd project-repo
$ git init project-repo
$ git add .
$ git merge juan/feature
```

## Question 6

Your Rails database has two tables. `students` has the columns `id` and `name`, and `sandwiches` has the columns `id`, `type`, and `student_id`.

```rb
# Your answer...

```

## Question 7

```

## Question 10

Using jQuery, write an AJAX request to `http://tunr.com/artists` that would create a new artist with the name of 'Resin Laying Deer Figurine, Gold', and pop up a box saying "All done!" when complete.

```js
// Your code starts here...

```

## Question 11

Due to budget cuts, GA can no longer hire new instructors. Instead they can only instantiate new instructors with Javascript.

Define a Javascript constructor called 'Instructor'. Every instance of Instructor should have a `name` property, and a method called `receivePresent`. This method takes one argument called `gift` and, when executed, console-logs "[name] promptly drops the [gift] on the floor."

Instantiate an instructor named 'Andy' and call its `receivePresent` method with "Resin Laying Deer Figurine, Gold" as the argument.

```js
// Your code starts here...

```

## Question 12

Your Rails app has the following `application.html.erb`. Nothing shows up in your browser on any of your app's pages. Why not?

```erb
<!DOCTYPE html
<html>
<head>
  <title>Quiz</title
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", media: "all", "data-turbolinks-track" => true %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag "application", "data-turbolinks-track" => true %>
