This webpage has 2400 `<span>` tags arranged in a grid. When you move your mouse over any one of them, its background color should become whatever has been written in the "Enter a color" field.

**Only edit the `you_do.js` file.** In that file is all the code you'll need. However, it has been split into bits and pieces and randomized. Copy and paste the bits and pieces into the correct order to make the code function.
