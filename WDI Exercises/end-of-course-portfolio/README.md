# Portfolio Lab

## Prompt

Finding time to work on your portfolio during WDI can be difficult. For this week's lab, we're giving you a day to work on your portfolio **and** apply some of what you've learned over the past three months. You are welcome to continue working on an existing portfolio or start working from scratch.

### Outcomes

First priority is to get the appropriate outcomes assignments on your portfolio. This includes, but is not limited to...
* A brand statement.
* A resume.
* A reference to at least one project.
* Contact information.

After -- **and only after!** -- you prepare the aforementioned content, implement at least one of the following in your portfolio...

### I. SASS

Write a stylesheet entirely in SASS. It should contain the following...
* Nested selectors.
* Variables.
* At least one mixin.
* At least one conditional statement.

> **NOTE:** `sass --watch` will make developing with SASS much easier. More info [here](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html).

### II. Angular

Convert your portfolio into a multi-state Angular application.
* You could use states to represent views for your resume, projects, about me page -- anything!

### III. Wordpress

Feeling adventurous? Convert your portfolio into a Wordpress application!
