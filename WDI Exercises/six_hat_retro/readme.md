# 6 Hats Retro

This morning we'll be conducting a retro utilizing the [six thinking hats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Thinking_Hats). It provides a means for groups to think together more effectively, and a means to plan thinking processes in a detailed and cohesive way. It's *important* that you stay in the scope of the current "hat", please try to keep each other well focused in each category.

> Use a whiteboard or other electronic means so everyone can see whats written down. Designate a scribe. The scribe will start a google timer for each section.

## The Blue hat (5m)
Use this hat to discuss the objectives for this retro. Write anything important down.

## The White hat (10m)
Participants write down facts about the last 2 weeks. Hunches or feelings about what these facts achieved or other non information based output should be left out of this discussion.

## The Yellow hat (10m)
Participants can only talk about good things that happened in the last iteration.

## The Black Hat (5m)
Participants can only talk about the bad things that happened, in an effort to create discussion points for the green hat(improving)

## The Green Hat (10m)
Move the discussion to how these problems can be solved going forward.

## The Red Hat (5m)
Each Participant has an opportunity to write 2 emotive statements each. These could be the issues that have stood out for them the most or an idea for solving a problem. These statements should be instinctive which is why you will get little time to do this.

## Conclusion and actions(5m)
Spend a little time as a group having a look at the Red Hat output. Are there any themes? Do any of them have relationships to each other. Do any particularly stand out? From this get the group to decide on a couple of actions to take away or improvements for future collaborative work.
