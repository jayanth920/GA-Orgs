# Pennies!

This simulation is designed to demonstrate the values of some of the principles of Lean/Agile Methodologies.

We will be simulating moving items through a system.  This could be products on an assembly line, user stories in a development project, or iterations in a project.

We will be simulating "work" by flipping coins over.

## The setup
We will separate into groups of about 7. Designate one person as the Product Owner and another as the Efficiency Expert.  The rest will be the Workers.

Every group will receive 20 coins of varying values (equal quantity of each value).

Once the setup is complete, move on to The Flow.

## The Flow

- The Product Owner is responsible for timing the whole process and assigning the work.  They will begin the simulation by starting the timer and passing the coins, one at a time, to the first Worker. They will stop their timer when the last Worker has flipped over the last coin.
- The "Efficiency Expert" will measure the time for a single Worker, the *last* Worker.  They will time from when the last Worker receives their first coin, till they flip the last coin.
- If a timing is missed, it's ok to guestimate.

Each group will enter their times into the timing form (also displayed in the room).  Timers please review the form and have questions ready in a minute.

## The Worker
Each "Worker" can not begin until they have received their entire batch of coins.  Once they have received their batch, they begin flipping coins.  Once they have flipped their entire batch, they can pass that batch to the next Worker.

## The Iterations.
Each iteration is defined below.  Once you complete an iteration:
- enter times and submit the form,
- reset the coins,
- prepare the timers,
- review the rules, and
- the Product Owner can begin when your group is ready.

Workers, any questions?
Timers, any questions?

## 1st Iteration
For the first iteration, the batch size is all 20 coins.

Each Worker will flip over all twenty coins, using *only* their non-dominant hand (usually the left hand).  Remember, a Worker can not begin work until they have received their entire batch.  Once they have flipped ALL 20, they can then pass ALL 20 to the next Worker.  This repeats until each Worker has flipped over every coin.

Product Owners begin your timers when you are ready.

## 2nd Iteration
For the next iteration, the batch size is 5.  

Each Worker will flip over 5 coins of the 20, again using only their non-dominant, than pass those 5 to the next Worker. They will repeat this until all 20 coins are flipped and passed to the next Worker. Once you have received 5 coins, you can start flipping and sending groups of 5.

## 3rd Iteration
For the next iteration, each Worker will flip 1 coin and immediately pass it to the next Worker.

## Optimal Batch Size
At this point, pause and identify which batch size is best for your group.  From this point on you will use that "optimal" batch size.

Given time, discuss.
> Q. How do you think we can improve the speed?
---

## [Optional] 4th Iteration
Pick a suggested optimization.
Recommended: 2 hands

## 5th Iteration
Using your optimal batch size, simulate localized optimization.  All Workers should use *both* hands.  Once a Worker has completed their batch, they can help other Workers.  But, Helpers can *only* use their non-dominant hand (simulating reduced familiarity with work).

## 6th Iteration
The group that received the 20 coins of varying values will run once more, this time the Product Owner only choses 10 coins (half the total inventory), but chooses wisely.  Simulating prioritizing by value.

## Discussion

Work with students to connect results to the upcoming projects.
Discuss data and feelings.
