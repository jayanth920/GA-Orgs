This exercise goes along with making calls to this api (https://tunr-api.herokuapp.com)
> First check to see if it is still up and running before continuing!

Here are examples of the main endpoints: 
* All artists: `https://tunr-api.herokuapp.com/artists.json`
* Single artist: `https://tunr-api.herokuapp.com/artists/1.json`
* All songs for a particular Artist: `https://tunr-api.herokuapp.com/artists/1/songs.json`
* A particular song of a particular Artist: `https://tunr-api.herokuapp.com/artists/1/songs/5.json`

***Instead of `1` or `5`, use the id of the artist and song you want to located***
