# Intro to Rails HW!!

Great job guys, you've already learned your very first web framework, Sinatra! And that's awesome!!

Your homework for this weekend is to read this weekend.

What you'll be reading:

[Getting Started with Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)
- Chapters 1 - 5

After you're finished reading, your assignment is to submit an issue to this repo with the following information:

- List two things how rails is different from Sinatra
- List two things how rails is similar to Sinatra

Objective- The point is not to understand everything. The point is to familiarize yourself with terminology and syntax to better prepare you for the upcoming week.
