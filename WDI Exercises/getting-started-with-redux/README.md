# Getting Started with Redux

[Redux](http://redux.js.org/) is a state-managment solution very commonly used with React. By accepting some restrictions in how we define and interact with state, Redux gives us some really neat tools and benefits some of which we will introduce in class and many others which we won't be able to get to and will be left to be explored.

For homework, before we cover Redux in class, watch at least the first four videos (up to and including "The Reducer Function") of [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) by Dan Abramov (author of Redux) on egghead.io. 

The whole Getting Started with Redux course is excellent and just over two hours but can take a while longer to work through. Watch as much as you would like and this will be a great series to return to as you get more familiar with Redux. There is a community created set of [course notes](https://github.com/tayiorbeii/egghead.io_redux_course_notes) that is also great reference.

Once you're comfortable with that material, checkout the second course, also by Dan Abramov, [Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux) with its [course notes](https://github.com/tayiorbeii/egghead.io_idiomatic_redux_course_notes)
