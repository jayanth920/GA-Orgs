# MEAN Lab

## Prompt

This is an open-ended pair lab! It is up to you and your teammate to come up with a project idea. It must, however, fulfill the following technical requirements...

## Technical Requirements

Your application should be MEAN. This includes...
* Using **MongoDB** as your database and **Mongoose** as your ODM.
* Using **Express** to handle HTTP requests and serve API endpoints.
* Adding **Angular** as your front-end. Express should only handle your root view as well as your API routes. Angular should take care of the rest via `ui.router`.
* Using **Node** to run your Express server

Your app should have CRUD functionality for at least one model.

### Bonus I

Add a second model to your application, which is embedded under the first.

### Bonus II

Allow the user to log-in using Twitter.

## Pairs

You will be working in pairs. We will leave the group selection up to you. Feel free find a partner after the lab has been introduced.

We recommend following a pair programming approach, in which one person is the "driver" and the other is the "navigator". Throughout the lab you will switch roles. More information can be found [here](https://www.versionone.com/agile-101/agile-software-programming-best-practices/pair-programming/).

### Some Ideas

- A StackOverflow-style question/answer page
- Recipe / Ingredients manager
- Competitive Cookie Clicker
- Image tagger
- A digital notebook

## Lab Submission

* A link to your lab repo
* A link to your deployed application (if you have one)
