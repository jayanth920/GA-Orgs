# Layout

This exercise is designed to be done in conjunction with [learn layout](http://learnlayout.com/)

Practice recreating each of the layouts covered in the article by modifying `edit.css`. You should not have to modify the `.html` files or `dontedit.css`. For part I you can view your progress by opening part1.html in the browser `$ open part1.html`, and a similar process for part II.

#### layouts part I:

1. [position 8/19](http://learnlayout.com/position-example.html)
- [float, fixed width 12/19](http://learnlayout.com/float-layout.html)
- [float, percent 13/19](http://learnlayout.com/percent.html)
- [media-queries, float, percent 14/19](http://learnlayout.com/media-queries.html)

#### layouts part II:

1. [inline-block, percent 16/19](http://learnlayout.com/inline-block-layout.html)
