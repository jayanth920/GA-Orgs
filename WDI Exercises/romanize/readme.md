# Romanize!

## Objective
Create a function that accepts an integer as an argument. It should than convert that number into its [roman numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals) equivalent.

```
2499 = MMCDXCIX
543 = DXLIII
13 = XIII
```

### Pairing!
You can do this challenge in either JS or Ruby. Pair with someone that wants to code in the same language as you. Ideally someone you've never worked with before!

### Pseudo Code!(10m)
No one is allowed to code for the first 10 minutes. Start writing down/typing how to break this problem down.

### Bonus 

- Create a web page that converts roman numerals
- Refactor to another language
