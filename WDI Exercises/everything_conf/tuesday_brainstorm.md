## Morning Brainstorm
You have an idea and some learning objectives. Fantastic. Find a partner and start to flesh out your presentation. Split time evenly so half is spent on your presentation and the other half is spent on your partner's presentation. Discuss the following:

- Learning Objectives. See if they are:
  - focused clearly
  - actionable
  - interesting
  - takeaways (something the audience should remember)
- Structure & Flow
  - General layout of presentation
  - time constraints
