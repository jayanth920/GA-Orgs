# BAMSAY!

1. `$ open index.html`
2. Recreate [BAMSAY](http://codepen.io/jshawl/full/cLJal), using only CSS (via Sass).

Check out the css.  Lots of text-shadow's, huh?  Do you want to type all of them?  I don't.

Let's systematize it.  Specify what it takes to draw these shadows and then **codify** it.

What is the element?  Start there.
Small steps.

Ensure your `sass --watch` statement works.

Add some basic styling.

Before long, you'll want to add all the text-shadows.

Take a look at the css:
```
text-shadow: -1px 0px 0px #fefefe,
-2px 1px 0px #fefefe,
-3px 2px 0px #fefefe,
-4px 3px 0px #fefefe,
-5px 4px 0px #fefefe,
-6px 5px 0px #fefefe,
...
-41px 40px 0px #fefefe
```

Start at?
Increment what?
Decrement what?
Until?

## Bonus:
- Display the basic text and grow it into BAMSAY!
- Rotate through colors.
