# Open Office Hours

Open office hours are generally from...
- 1:30PM to 2:30PM on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday
- 6:00PM to 8:00PM on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.

The format is informal: the instructors "on duty" hang out by the student work area, and if you get stuck, you can wander over and ask them a question, following the [guidelines on asking for help](asking-for-help.md).

Using this time to receive one-on-one guidance with technical issues and areas in which you are struggling is critical to your success in the class. We highly encourage you to complete your homework on campus during Office Hour periods.

You are strongly encouraged to use these times to also work with fellow students on assignments and projects.
