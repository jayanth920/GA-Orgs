# SQLAlchemy

## Learning Objectives

- Define ORM and why we use it over a database language.
- Explain what SQLAlchemy is and what problems it solves.
- Define a class that inherits from SA
- Utilize SA to perform CRUD actions on a database
- Establish relationships with SA
- Seed a database using SA
- Draw an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) using proper notation


## Framing

So far, you've learned how to interact with a database using SQL.

Specifically, you used postgresql. In today's lesson, we're doing to work with SQLite, which is similar, but distributable via the file system.

Today's all about querying the database using Python.

## Querying the DB w/ Python

Instead of interacting with the database directly via the CLI (using a tool like `psql`), we can use the `sqlite3` module to use Python to query the DB.

> See code/01-sqlite/app.py

[sqlite3 documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html)

This is an improvement over executing SQL independently. A few problems still remain:

- Having to write both SQL and Python is confusing
- Susceptible to [SQL injection](http://www.acunetix.com/websitesecurity/sql-injection/) w/o sanitization
- Cursor is non-intuitive

## ORMs

### Doc Dive (5 mins)

Read the following docs

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping
- http://www.sqlalchemy.org/

### Turn and Talk (5 mins)

Now, turn & talk to your neighbor and discuss:

- At a high level, what are ORM's and how might they be useful?
- What is the importance of having an interface between python and the DB?

### Recap

- ORMs map tables to Python objects
  - `Person` in python corresponds to `person` sql table
- Really only need to use Python syntax w/ ORMs
- Use built-in python methods like `.filter` instead of SQL functions `LIKE`, `WHERE`

## SQLAlchemy

SQLAlchemy is one of [many Python ORMs](https://www.fullstackpython.com/object-relational-mappers-orms.html).

### We Do Person model and People Seeds

#### Install sqlalchemy

```
$ pip install sqlalchemy
```

#### Set up Class Definition (model) and DB Tables

```python
# person.py

from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
Base = declarative_base()

class Person(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'person'
    # Here we define columns for the table person
    # Notice that each column is also a normal Python instance attribute.
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String(250), nullable=False)

    # nicer output in the terminal
    def __repr__(self):
      return "Person(id=%r,name=%r)" % (self.id,self.name)

# Create an engine that stores data in the local directory's
# people.db file.
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///people.db')

# Create all tables in the engine. This is equivalent to "Create Table"
# statements in raw SQL.
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

#### Seed the database

```python
# seeds.py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from person import Base, Person

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///people.db')
# Bind the engine to the metadata of the Base class so that the
# declaratives can be accessed through a DBSession instance
Base.metadata.bind = engine

DBSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
# A DBSession() instance establishes all conversations with the database
# and represents a "staging zone" for all the objects loaded into the
# database session object. Any change made against the objects in the
# session won't be persisted into the database until you call
# session.commit(). If you're not happy about the changes, you can
# revert all of them back to the last commit by calling
# session.rollback()
session = DBSession()

# Insert a Person in the person table
session.add(Person(name='new person'))
session.add(Person(name='other third person'))
session.commit()

# Pause the program's execution and enter a repl
import code; code.interact(local=dict(globals(), **locals()))
```

##  Relationships

#### ERDs

- An ERD is a tool we use to visualize and describe the data relating to the
  major entities that will exist in out programs.
- Ultimately lends itself to planning out and creating our database table
  structure.
- We keep our data separate from our behavior.
- There are multiple syntaxes or schemas for diagramming this data.  Here's a
  diagram for an orchard, generated by the `rails-erd` gem.

![erd](http://voormedia.github.io/rails-erd/images/orchard-bachman.png)

- The squares represent our entities and are filled with the attributes associated with our entity.
- The arrows between the squares indicate how the entities relate to one another.
  - There are several types of relationships:
    - One-to-many: An Company has many Orchards
    - Many-to-many: An Orchard has many PickingRobots and a PickingRobot works in many Orchards
      - Requires a join table.
    - One-to-one: A User has one Profile
      - Usually denotes that one entity should be an attribute of the other
      - Usually separated for physical space considerations

More relationship examples:
- one to one
  - fiancee has one fiancee
- one to many
  - one class has many students
- many to one
  - one student has many assignments
- many to many
  - one product has many orders
  - one order has many products

#### We Do: Library ERD Example

As a class, let's come up with an example ERD for an application that manages
a library.

### Exercise: Spotify ERD

In groups of 3, create your own ERD for Spotify. You can keep it as simple or
complex as you like.

At a minimum though, you should have Songs and Artists as entities.

### One to Many

A person has many addresses. An address belongs to a person.
The way we represent these relationships in a relational DB
is through the use of foreign keys.

#### Person

| id | name |
| --- | --- |
| 6 | Jesse |
| 7 | Scott |

#### Address

| id | street_name | street_number | post_code | person_id |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |--- |
| 1 | 34th Street | 8907 | 21740 | 6 |
| 2 | 15th Street | 1133 | 20002 | 6 |

Each address has a `person_id` field. You might want to think of this as "Each address belongs to a person"

## We do: Modify people from 02 to have many addresses

http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/basic_relationships.html

```python
# person.py

from sqlalchemy import Column, ForeignKey, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

Base = declarative_base()

class Person(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'person'
    # Here we define columns for the table person
    # Notice that each column is also a normal Python instance attribute.
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String(250), nullable=False)
    addresses = relationship(Address, back_populates="person")

class Address(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'address'
    # Here we define columns for the table address.
    # Notice that each column is also a normal Python instance attribute.
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    street_name = Column(String(250))
    street_number = Column(String(250))
    post_code = Column(String(250), nullable=False)
    person_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('person.id'))
    person = relationship(Person, back_populates='addresses')
# Create an engine that stores data in the local directory's
# people.db file.
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///people.db')

# Create all tables in the engine. This is equivalent to "Create Table"
# statements in raw SQL.
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

### You do:

Add a Job's model that belongs to a person: `A person has many jobs`

## Joins

SQL joins are required in order to implement many-to-many relationships.

In this example, a third table is created that does nothing but link the two other
tables together.

From one Instructor, we can find many courses by looking in the `CourseInstructor` table
where the instructor_id is the same.

From one Course, we can find many instructors by looking in the `CourseInstructor` table
where the course_id is the same.
