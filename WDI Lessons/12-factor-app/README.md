# The Twelve-Factor App

## Objectives
- Understand the conventions of the 12-Factor App.
- Be able to build applications which follow the 12-Factor App conventions.

## Introduction (10 min / 0:10)

### Why it's important to follow conventions?
Conventions make it easy to work together. Having standards in our applications make collaboration, debugging, deployment, and production more easier and more efficient.

### Important Conventions
In the previous lessons, we have learned a few important programming conventions, such as:
- Agile and scrum
- Separation of Concerns
- DRY code
- Clean Code
- Convention over Configuration
- Commit early, commit often
- Deploy early, deploy often

Today we are going to learn a more sophisticated, and a more important set of conventions.

### The Twelve-Factor App
The 12-Factor App is a collection of 12 conventions which most modern application follow. It doesn't matter which languages, frameworks, or libraries you are using, you can always build a 12-Factor App.

## You Do: The Twelve-Factor App Conventions  (15 min / 0:25)
Each student will be assigned a convention to read about, and present later to class. You can read about these conventions here: https://12factor.net/.

I. Codebase

II. Dependencies

III. Config

IV. Backing services

V. Build, release, run

VI. Processes

VII. Port binding

VIII. Concurrency

IX. Disposability

X. Dev/prod parity

XI. Logs

XII. Admin processes

## Presentations  (30 min / 0:55)
Each student will have 2-3 mins to present one of the conventions to the class.
