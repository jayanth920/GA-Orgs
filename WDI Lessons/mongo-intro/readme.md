## Learning Objectives

- Introduce databases, specifically non-relational databases
- Setup local MongoDB server
- Define what a document is in the context of MongoDB
- CRUD documents using Mongo CLI
- Build a simple node CLI to query MongoDB

## Framing (James)

What's the main problem with our programs right now in terms of user
experience?

When we quit them, any data / progress is lost! Right now, we can only store
information in memory, which is wiped when we quit out of a program. We
need a way to fix this.

Enter databases...

## Databases (15 minutes / 0:15 / Ali)

A database is a tool for storing data. There are many ways to store data on a computer (e.g., writing to a text file, a binary file). Databases, however, offer a number of advantages...

**Permanence**: Once we write data to our database, we can be pretty sure it
won't be lost (unless the server catches on fire).

**Speed**: Databases are generally optimized to be fast at retrieving and updating information. Literally, DBs can be 100,000x faster than reading from a file.

**Consistency**: Databases can enforce rules regarding consistency of data, especially when handling simultaneous requests to update information.

**Scalability**: Databases can handle lots of requests per second, and many DBs have ways to scale to massive loads by replicating / syncing information across multiple DBs.

**Querying**: DBs make it easy to search, sort, filter and combine related data using a **Query Language**.

One type of database is the **relational** database, in which data is organized by columns and rows, much like an Excel spreadsheet.

Today, we are going to explore non-relational databases.

MongoDB is an open-source **document database** that provides:

- High Performance
- High Availability
- Automatic Scaling

**When dealing with less complex associations, non-relational databases can be more
effective**.  Mongo provides a more flexible, scalable solution for storing data.

### Terminology

While this is a bit technical, it's worth clarifying some terminology...

* **Database**: The actual set of data being stored. We may create multiple databases on our computer, often one for each application.

* **Database Management System**: The software that lets a user interact (query) the data in a database. Examples are MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.
* **Database CLI**: A tool offered by most DBMSs that allows us to query the database from the command line. For MongoDB, we'll use `mongo`.

## Document Database (10 min / 0:25 / James) 

### A basic example of a `Person` document:

```json
{
  "name": "Sue",
  "age": 26,
  "status": "Active",
  "groups": ["sass", "express"]
}
```
---
TPS: What do you see in the data above?

### A Document

**A record in MongoDB is a document.**

- a data structure composed of field (key) and value pairs
  - similar to JSON objects ([JavaScript Object Notation](https://www.mongodb.com/json-and-bson) is a JS object converted into text to be parsed easily by machines)
  - stored as BSON [(binary-encoded JSON)](http://bsonspec.org/ )
- a document can support all data types - numbers, strings, booleans, even arrays
- fields may include other documents and arrays of documents
- a document is analogous to rows in a table

[Documentation Here] (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/introduction/)

### More complicated example of a `Restaurant` document:

```json
{
   "_id" : ObjectId("54c955492b7c8eb21818bd09"),
   "address" : {
      "street" : "2 Avenue",
      "zipcode" : "10075",
      "building" : "1480",
      "coord" : [ -73.9557413, 40.7720266 ],
   },
   "borough" : "Manhattan",
   "cuisine" : "Italian",
   "grades" : [
      {
         "date" : ISODate("2014-10-01T00:00:00Z"),
         "grade" : "A",
         "score" : 11
      },
      {
         "date" : ISODate("2014-01-16T00:00:00Z"),
         "grade" : "B",
         "score" : 17
      }
   ],
   "name" : "Vella",
   "restaurant_id" : "41704620"
}
```

## Collections (5 min / 0:30 / James)

MongoDB stores documents in collections.

- collections are analogous to tables in relational databases
- does **NOT** require its documents to have the same schema
- documents stored in a collection must have a unique `_id` field that acts as a primary key

###  MongoDB & NoSQL vs. SQL and Relational Databases

    A SQL  ___________            ...is like...           A Mongo  ____________

---

Great, now that we have a high level understanding of what Mongo is and what purpose it serves, let's look at how to use it!

## Installation (10 min / 0:40 / Ali)

### Don't Do This Unless You Don't Already Have MongoDB installed

Check with `$ mongo --version`. If you already have it installed you should see output like this...

```sh
$ mongo --version

git version: 3287gd3278df73fd783fd781f23d8f187
OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.2l  25 May 2017
allocator: system
modules: none
build environment:
    distarch: x86_64
    target_arch: x86_64
```

If you already have mongo installed, skip to the **Mongo Shell** section.

Otherwise, follow the instructions below.

### Installation Instructions

#### Proceed only if you don't have installed! Consult the previous section.

If you already have mongo installed, skip to the **Mongo Shell** section.

- Mac OS X
    1. Install mongodb with brew

        ```bash
        brew install mongodb
        ```

    2. Create the folder mongo will be using to store your databases

        ```bash
        sudo mkdir -p /data/db
        ```

    3. Change permission so your user account owns this folder you just created

        ```bash
        sudo chown -R $(whoami) /data/db
        ```

    > Type these commands exactly as displayed, you don't need to substitute anything.

- [Linux Instructions on the mongodb website](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/)

### Start mongo:

In a new tab in Terminal:

```
$ mongod
```

You should see:

`a bunch of output but with the prompt hanging`
> This is good news, `mongod` just starts up a mongo server locally. **NOTE**: you need this running in order to use the mongo cli

### More info?

```
$ brew info mongo
```

## Mongo shell (10 min / 0:50 / James)



### Start the shell

Back in your original Terminal tab:

```
$ mongo
```

> feels a little bit like a JS REPL

You should see:

```
MongoDB shell version: 3.x.x
connecting to: test
>
```

### Help

```
> help
```

#### ThinkShare (2min):
Based on what you see in the help menu:
- What jumps out as important?
- What might be useful for debugging?

<details>
<summary>Some things that jump out:</summary>

- `show dbs`: show database names
- `show collections`:  show collections in current database
- `use <db_name>`: set current database
- `db.foo.find()`: list objects in collection foo

Also:

- `<tab>` key completion
- `<up-arrow>` and the `<down-arrow>` for history.
</details>

## Break (10 min / 1:00)

### CLI: Creating a Database (Ali)

In the Mongo REPL, let's go ahead and create our first database, one which we will be using to store information about restaurants.

In order to create/connect to a new database, we have to tell mongo to `use` a specific database that we want to work with:

```
> use restaurant_db
```
> **Note**: `use` will create the database it received as an argument if not already initialized and connect to it

Verify:

```
> db
restaurant_db
```
> **Note**: the `db` variable is provided by mongo and will point to the currently connected database

Common Gotcha - what happens when we run:

```
$ show dbs
```

> **Note**: we don't see `restaurant_db` listed. It isn't until we add a document to
our database that our db will show up in `show dbs`.

## CLI: Create a record (15 min / 1:20 / Ali)

### Insert

- use `insert()` to add documents to a collection

### Insert a restaurant

``` json
> db.restaurants.insert(
   {
      "name": "Cookies Corner",
      "address" : {
         "street" : "1970 2nd St NW",
         "zipcode" : 20001,
      },
      "yelp": "http://www.yelp.com/biz/cookies-corner-washington"
   })
```

**Important to note**:
> The `db` is the database we???re connected to. In this case, `restaurant_db`.
`.restaurants` is then referring to a collection in our `restaurant_db`. We
use the `.insert()` to add the document inside the parentheses.

### Verify the insert
```bash
> show collections
restaurants
```

Note: `restaurants` was saved as a collection

```js
> db.restaurants.find()
```

Returns documents with the following fields:
- `name`
- `address`
- `yelp`

**Q**. What is surprising/unexpected?

- Where did `restaurants` come from?
- `_id`?


> Note: Documentation on [ObjectId](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/object-id/)

## Review `insert`
```js
// insert
> db.your_collection_name.insert({ data as json })
// find
> db.your_collection_name.find()
```

New Record:
- If the document passed to the `insert()` method does not contain the `_id` field the mongo shell automatically adds the field to the document and sets the field???s value to a generated `ObjectId`.

New collection:
- If you attempt to add documents to a collection that does not exist,
MongoDB will create the collection for you.

## Dropping a Database

```bash
> use random_db
> db.dropDatabase()
```

Drops the **current** database.

### Exercise (5 minutes): Add a few more restaurants. (James)

Using the Mongo Shell CLI, add at least 4 new restaurant documents to your `restaurants` collection.

**ProTip**: I recommend you construct your statements in your editor and copy /
paste. It will help you now & later.

> Prompt: Did anyone insert multiple at one time?

Let's recreate the steps together:

<details>
	<summary>How can we tell which database we are connected to currently?</summary>
	`db`
</details>

1. Create DB
2. Use the appropriate DB
3. Insert multiple restaurants

``` json
db.restaurants.remove({});
db.restaurants.insert([
  {
    "name": "Cookies Corner",
    "address": {
      "street" : "1970 2nd St NW",
      "zipcode" : 20001
    },
    "yelp": "http://www.yelp.com/biz/cookies-corner-washington"
  },
  {
    "name": "The Blind Dog Cafe",
    "address": {
      "street": "944 Florida Ave",
      "zipcode": 20001
    },
    "yelp": "http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-blind-dog-cafe-washington-2?osq=cookies"
  },
  {
    "name": "Birch & Barley",
    "address": {
      "street": "1337 14th St NW",
      "zipcode": 20005
    },
    "yelp": "http://www.yelp.com/biz/birch-and-barley-washington?osq=Restaurants+cookies"
  },
  {
    "name": "Captain Cookie and the Milk Man",
    "address": {
      "street": "Dupont Circle",
      "zipcode": 20036
    },
    "yelp": "http://www.yelp.com/biz/captain-cookie-and-the-milk-man-washington-5"
  },
  {
    "name": "J's Cookies",
    "address": {
      "street": "1700 N Moore St",
      "zipcode": 22209
    },
    "yelp": "http://www.yelp.com/biz/js-cookies-arlington" }
])

> db.restaurants.count()
```

## [Primary key](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/glossary/#term-primary-key) (5 min / 1:25 / James)

- A record???s unique immutable identifier generated upon creation of a new instance.
- In relational databases, the primary key is usually an *id* field, the value of which is typically an *Integer*.
- In MongoDB, the *_id* field is usually a *[BSON](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/glossary/#term-bson) [ObjectId](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/glossary/#term-objectid)*.

## Break (10 min / 1:35)

## CLI: QUERY for Records (25 min / 2:00 / Ali)

Breaking down the anatomy of a typical query with Mongo:

    collection + operation + modification = results

In order to find all restaurants:
```js
> db.restaurants.find()
```

> **Note**: we can format our output to be a little nicer on the eyes by chaining the `.pretty()` method to end of our query like so: `db.restaurants.find().pretty()`

### Find by Conditions (like SQL's `where`)

We can add conditions to our query to target documents based on matching key-value pairs:

```js
> db.restaurants.find({name: "Cookies Corner"});
> db.restaurants.find({"address.zipcode": 20001});
```

### CLI: Update a record(s)

http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/write-operations-introduction/

```
> db.your_collection.update(
  { criteria },
  {
    $set: { assignments }
  },
  { options }
)
```

> **Note**: the first key value pair is the condition on which to find the document you'd like to update, the second
is what values you'd like to set, and third is any additional options

### You do (15 min):

Take time to think about and execute the appropriate commands so that you:

- Update all restaurants to have a new key-value pair `{state: 'DC'}`
- Add a property of `rating` to at least 2 documents and give it a numerical value between 1-5
- Change the street `address` of a specific restaurant

**Bonus**
- Add nested sub-documents to each restaurant to that it has many `reviews`
- Store important information about each `review`
---

> **Note** this what a sample update might look like:

```js
> db.restaurants.update(
  {"name": "Cookies Corner"},
  { $set: { state: "DC" }}
)
```

> **Note**: In order to update multiple documents at a time, make sure to pass the `multi` option as true, like so:

```js
db.restaurants.update(
  {},
  {
    $set: { "state": "DC" }
  },
  {multi: true}
)
```

Verify:

```js
> db.restaurants.find().pretty()
```

### CLI: Remove records

```
> db.restaurants.remove({ conditions })
```

### CLI: Add a nested object

> We already did this! (The address 'object' / 'subdocument')

## Closing: Review Mongo's Key Advantages (15 min / 2:15 / James)

- Usability
- High Performance
- High Availability
- Automatic Scaling
- No SQL

### Usability

- Documents (i.e. objects) correspond to native data types in many programming languages.
- Schema-less: no need to manage migrations.

### High Performance

- Embedded documents and arrays reduce need for expensive joins (reduces I/O).
- Indexes support faster queries and can include keys from embedded documents and arrays. (More info on MongoDB indexing [here](https://dev.to/akazia_it/introduction-to-mongodb-indexing).)

### High Availability

MongoDB???s replication facility, called replica sets, provide:

- automatic failover.
- data redundancy.

replica set:
> is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set, providing
redundancy and increasing data availability.

### Automatic Scaling

- Automatic sharding distributes data across a cluster of machines.
- Replica sets can provide eventually-consistent reads for low-latency high
throughput deployments.
