# Don't Build A Skyscraper

You're a freshly-minted junior developer. Now you need to get a job. But you don't **know** anything.

Yes, you *understand* that "you know more than you think you know," and that "all junior developers feel like this," and that "every developer is just making it up as they go along."

But understanding and *feeling* are different things. Besides, someone else saying "been there, done that" won't put food on your table.

You've spent hours agonizing over your r&eacute;sum&eacute; and your LinkedIn profile, and still no fish are nibbling.

You gone through so many tutorials, but no-one knows you've done them, you can't *do* anything with them. At this point it's [mental masturbation](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Mental+Masturbation).

You could make an app. Maybe a two-model CRUD app, like a very simple social network or bookmark tracker. But you've already started five of those and [have yet to finish one](http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2014/11/25/west-side-project-story/). If you do the UI first then the back-end is overwhelming; if you do the back-end first then the UI is a pain. And then you have to get people to actually use it.

### So what *do* you do?

Make something small and stupid.

It's hard to get someone to use an app. It's easy to get someone to look at a page called [DucksAreTheBest.com](http://ducksarethebest.com/).

It probably took half an hour to make. It does absolutely nothing.

It has been [shared 32,000 times on Facebook and is worth $30,000](http://www.siteprice.org/website-worth/ducksarethebest.com).

The guy who created [PleaseDonate.biz](http://pleasedonate.biz) in 5 minutes allegedly [earned $35,000 by 2013](https://www.quora.com/How-much-money-has-been-donated-at-pleasedonate-biz).

[/r/InternetIsBeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/top/?sort=top&t=all) has over 5,000,000 subscribers and its #3 link is pure CSS. It's not even hosted on its own domain.

### Build things that are silly, because people like silly things

Not only can you gain notoriety and possibly even money: you will learn a tremendous amount making even the most mundane, goofy things.

This is the one of the **two best things you can do to advance your career right now**. The other is:

### Teach. That is: get paid to network and learn

You may be "just" a junior developer, but you know more about the world's fastest-growing industry than 99% of the world's population. That 99% *wants* to know what you know.

Teach an hour-long class on the very basics of HTML and CSS at your library or your church. Teach for free, and then start charging. In return, you get:

- Networking. Your students will come to you if they need a designer or developer.

- Knowledge. No-one expects you to know all the answers. The questions you're asked will dramatically deepen your knowledge of development.

- Reputation. Nothing says "I'm a confident, caring developer who communicates well" like having taught a class. Evidence of your ability to function on a team is just as important as evidence of your ability to code.

**The two most enjoyable and marketable things in development are building stuff and talking about building stuff.** Do these, and you'll find them doing the networking for you.
