## Framing

### [Please clone down this repo.](https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/tunr_rails_users)

```
$ cd tunr_rails_users
$ git checkout 1-added-users
$ bundle update
$ bundle install
$ rails db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed
$ rails s
```

> Make sure to run `bundle update` after checking out a new branch in today's lesson. This'll will fix any errors that result from upgrading to Rails 5.

This class is going to be mostly you walking through README files with a partner, adding functionality to Tunr.

### Logistics

With your partner, please pick one computer to be the "driving" computer and the other to be the "navigating" computer.

All of the coding will be done on the "driving" computer. The "navigating" computer will be used for looking things up.

After each section, we'll ask you to *physically* switch computers: whoever was on the "driving" computer should start using the "navigating" computer, and vice-versa.

This means...
- By the end of class only one of the two computers will have any code on it.
- You will be using someone else's computer (so wash your hands and cover your mouth when you sneeze).

This is a great way to practice "pair programming" and "rubber ducking."

### Do Not Copy And Paste

You will benefit greatly from typing everything out, even when you are provided with the answer.
