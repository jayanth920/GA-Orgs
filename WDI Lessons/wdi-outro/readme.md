## Managing Imposter Syndrome

- Accepting the stress of not knowing, to whatever extent you can in the moment

> Imposter syndrome sticks with you

It is inevitable and natural that we will experience imposter syndrome. Many experienced developers I've encountered have talked to me or around about their experiences with imposter syndrome. It persists well into a career! This is just one side of the coin

It's also what developers say motivates them and provides job satisfaction. Job stress = job satisfaction? Not exactly, but ***the life of a developer entails learning new things all the time***. The difficult aspects of this relate to imposter syndrome. However, this has a more positive aspect as well that has more to do with job satisfaction in that it is not only rewarding
to overcome obstacles, but that the work is mentally stimulating.

> Accepting or managing developer stress

I think there is a certain, mostly irreducible base level of the stress related to "not knowing", but that accepting it somehow makes it more manageable. This sounds almost vacuous, but I think it entails a certain process that actually isn't all that mysterious. It goes something like this:

> Managing or accepting the stress of not having every answer

It is inevitable that we will have an "oh #@œ∑®†¥¡£∞!$§•ª•&¶, I don't actually know" reaction in many situations. Every subsequent reaction to that feeling/thought relates to how we manage or react to that initial moment of panic. It may be that we are managing this feeling more than we are accepting it, but the way we frame this moment of fear has important consequences for our state of mind.


We will have access to informational resources that will help us find answers to our questions

### Learning on the job

Many of us will take jobs working with technologies that have not been covered over the course of the class.

### Another Day (really, Another 3 seconds), Another Error

Errors do not make us bad programmers, on the contrary they actually guide development. It takes some time to understand the errors that we get. Sometimes this is easier than others-- think of Rails and React.

We get the clearest guidance from errors when ***we write a few lines of code and then test them***. By thinking critically or focusing on what we expect our code to be doing, our code-related thought processes mature. Verifying or modifying our expectations about our code truly solidifies this maturation process.

Maximizing the certainty you take with each step is another way to manage the stress of not knowing.

### Teach what you do know, then do what you don't know quite as well (Robin)

Grow Your Network, Sharpen Your Skills!

That is -- teach!

The first class I taught was a free "Intro to Web Design" in the basement of the Shaw Library, about a year and a half ago. I didn't know much except basic HTML, CSS, and jQuery (not Vanilla JS) -- where you guys were at the end of Week 1. Most of the "students" were older than I was. I was nervous and didn't teach very well. But the students were so appreciative!

I got many contacts out of that one free lesson, which turned into friendships and paid work later on, which turned into motivation to keep on teaching. The questions students asked highlighted the gaps in my knowledge, and gave me things to work on at a point when I was feeling very "stuck" in my career. Eventually, my classes snowballed into a job at GA.

I think teaching is the best thing you can do for your career at this point, and maybe at all points. Teaching will show you both what you don't know, and what you thought you didn't know that you actually do. You may be a new developer, but you're light years ahead of 99% of the world — and that 99% desperately wants the skills you now have.

And you're not just a developer. You had a career before you came to GA. You have much more knowledge and experience than just WDI. That gives you a perspective that's extraordinary both among teachers, and among the other folks interviewing for development jobs. With each cohort I have the opportunity to learn about the unique careers and experiences of 60 different people!

Don't underestimate yourself. The best thing you can do right now -- for yourself, and for others -- is to go out and teach.

### Staying Hungry

Perhaps paradoxically, the best way to manage imposter syndrome is to own it!
In some sense, staying hungry is a strategy for taking control of your relationship with what you don't know. It's a ***growth mindset*** that can turn something that seems to be a barrier to entry into a frontier--in fact, this is the hacker mentality or growth mindset in a nutshell. If you have doubts about your ability to turn a wall into a step, that is normal. However, to challenge your own sense of having definite limits, think of how far you've come in the last 12 weeks (or even last 2 weeks).


## Stay Hungry (Nayana)

* Stay hungry... there's always:
	* more to learn
	* a better way to do what you're trying to do
	* entire worlds / paradigms in programming that you've probably never heard of, let alone understand
* Become Mediocre: That is, surround yourself with better developers.
	* Work
		* Work will be one way to do this for many of you, but you may not be so lucky, and at some point, you may be the best developer at your company (crazy, right?)
	* Non-work Peers
		* Attend meetups, conferences, etc.
	* Find a mentor
		* The good news is that there are lots of people who know a lot about programming, and may be willing to mentor you.
		* Finding a mentor isn't easy, but some things might help:
		  * work in the open
		  	* people giving feedback on a github commit is valuable, and could lead to longer discussions on code
		  	* people are more willing to help those who help others
		  * serve as a mentor for others
		    * many of you are fortunate to have some structured ways in which you'll be helping others, for those of you who don't, seek out organizations devoted to helping people
		    	* they often have training / resources
		    * teaching is a fantastic way to improve your skills
		  	* people are more willing to help those who help others
* Find an accountabili-buddy: set measurable, achievable goals for yourself.
	* Walk through [leveling up as a developer](http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2011/08/09/programming-achievements-how-to-level-up-as-a-developer/)
	* Learn a variety of programming paradigms:
	* Experience the ins and outs of programming for different platforms:
	* Enhance your understanding of the building blocks that we use as developers:
	* Enlighten yourself with koans, katas, and the wisdom of ages:
	* Program in the open:
	* Learn by teaching others:
* Read a book
* Read source code (i.e. for rails, backbone, underscore, or anything that you use).
* Every bug you fix is a level up, but you have to understand why it happened. (Root cause analysis)
* Listen to podcasts (railscasts, Ruby Rogues, etc)
* Understand that all programming happens in a domain. Learn the domain you're working in well, and own it.
* Take responsibility for the code that you write. Be professional.
* Focus on quality.

## Effort (Andy)

You all have accomplished so much in such a little time, but what’s next? There’s always a “next".. But before we go into what “next” maybe is for you all, I’d like to share a rather personal story of mine.

A little less than a decade ago, I was not doing so well. I was attending Virginia Tech at the time and things we’re not going swimmingly. I stopped taking care of myself, stopped attending classes. I just played video games, partied a lot and did other .. recreational activities. You may even say I hit that proverbial rock bottom. It was the lowest point I had ever been in my life. My thought at the time was, I need to change myself and I need some sort of stimulus to start this process. So I joined the army.

I remember being at a hotel that the army put me up in the day before I was shipped to basic training. I also vividly remembering making a mental decision to give the army everything I had. Every ounce of motivation, every drop of dedication went into making me the best damn Soldier I could be. And so I did. I excelled in the Army  and as I matured and developed not only as a Soldier but also as an adult, I realized that this mindset, the one that allowed me to excel as   a Soldier, was also the mindset I should have for the rest of my life. Since that first day of basic training my life has been challenging, but extremely rewarding.

You guys have all gotten to this point because you tried really hard and were challenged during your time in GA! Now’s the time to maintain that mindset of a lifelong learner for what’s next. So what’s next? It doesn’t matter what’s next. I can guarantee that the efforts you put into what’s next is the most important. At the end of the day, you, yourself are accountable for the things that happen in your life. Make the most of it, and make what happens NEXT, awesome.
