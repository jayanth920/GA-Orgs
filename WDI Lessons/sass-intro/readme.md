# Flexbox & Sass

CSS can be a pain. In today's lesson, we will talk about two tools -- [Flexbox](./flexbox.md) and [Sass](./sass.md) -- that will make the styling process a little less stressful.

This lesson is broken down into two parts:

1. [Flexbox](./flexbox.md)
2. [Sass](./sass.md)

# Learning Objectives
