# File upload with express and AWS S3

## Prerequisites

-   [aws-s3-setup-guide](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/aws-s3-setup-guide)
-   [express-api](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/express-api)

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Upload files from a browser

## Preparation

1.  [Fork and clone](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone)
    this repository.
1.  Create a new branch, `training`, for your work.
1.  Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Introduction

This repo is part of the `browser-upload` sequence. If you came here first,
you likely want to go check out [browser-upload repo](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/browser-upload), and come back when
prompted. The api that we'll eventually use with this client is
[express-api-upload](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/express-api-upload).

## Discussion

The point of this repo is to show the difference between sending data across
the internet. Up until now, we've only ever sent JSON. Using this repo in
coordination with the other repos in this sequence, we'll build a full feature
photo upload!
