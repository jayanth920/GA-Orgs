- Copy and pasting code you don't understand never works.
- Start with what you know, which is more than you think.
- Small steps. <em>Smaller.</em>
- Slow down to speed up.
- Write one line of code, refresh, fix any errors, and <em>then</em> continue (and only then).
- It's OK to start over! That said, never delete your code; just create a new branch.
- "Working" is better than "perfect".
- Don't thrash.
- Don't throw spaghetti at the wall hoping some of it sticks.
- Get out of your head.

- Is your blue elephant running?
- Branch early; branch often.
- Deploy early; deploy often.
- The first iteration of your idea is always too big.
- The "soft skills" and "fuzzy skills" are the most underestimated, the most difficult, and the most important.
- If something seems "too simple", do it first, and do it fast.
- An app that is <strong>You</strong> is better than an app that is "good".
- If that "time-saving" framework has taken you 3 extra days to figure out, it's not time-saving.
- The computer does exactly what you tell it to do. This is good and bad.
- If you're too stuck, go to sleep. If you can't sleep, brush your teeth.
- Always sniff your code.
- Smooth seas never made a skilled sailor.
- Short of dumping water on it and <kbd>sudo rm -rf /</kbd>, it's almost impossible to break your computer.
- DCMS: <kbd>rake db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed</kbd>
- Don't be afraid to write code you'll throw out later.
- <kbd>new_errors === progress</kbd>
- Indent your code.
