Web developers are people who specialize in building applications whose primary interface is a web browser,
with communication over the HTTP protocol.

## Agile Workflows

- scrum & sprints
- features & User Stories
  - User stories focus on the end goal for the user.
  - Developers use them to single out features and bug fixes to work on.
  - They are categorized by:
    - current: Active and most important stories
    - backlog: less important, but do after current
    - icebox: the "someday" list of stories
- vs. waterfall
  - Throwing things over the wall

## You do: WDI Project 2 User Stories

This is the project the WDI students just completed. - https://github.com/ga-dc/pbj-project2#potential-project-ideas

Given a user story template:

> As a <type of user>, I want to do <some action> so that <some reason>.

Create user stories in groups of 3

For example:

> As a logged-out user, I want to see all posts by all authors so that I can read what others are posting.

and

> As a logged-in user, I want to see a link to create a new post so that I can easily author new content.

## Contributing to Code

### Git && GitHub

Git is a program you can use to track changes to files. It's a very popular alternative to something
like Microsoft Word's versions:
