## Framing

In this lesson, we will be focusing on the many features that Ruby on Rails and ActiveRecord provide us to set up and maintain our database and models. The files weâ€™ll be working with in this lesson are highlighted in blue below...

## We Do: Set Up a Rails Application (10 minutes / 0:10)

Run the below command in Terminal to create a new Rails application...  

```bash
$ rails new tunr -d postgresql
```
> `-d postgresql` is important! It tells our application that we will be using postgres as our database. Otherwise, Rails uses SQLite as a database by default.  

This creates a lot of new files in a directory called `tunr`. We can easily keep track of what files have changed if we use version control...  

```bash
$ cd tunr
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "initial commit"
```
> NOTE: As of Rails 5, `rails new` will automatically run `git init` upon project creation

Let's explore some of the files that were created...  

### `tunr/config/database.yml`

Specifies the database connection options. By default, rails uses the development options detailed in this file.  

> `.yml` stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language". It's often used as a configuration file in Rails (and elsewhere).  

To create the database, run the following in the Terminal...

```bash
$ rails db:create
```

How can we tell this actually created the database? Run the following in the terminal. If you see a `psql` prompt then you're good to go...

```bash
$ rails db
```

Rails also gives us a very helpful way to load up all the models in our application, and play with them in the console...

```bash
$ rails c
```

#### What does the `rails` command do?

When developing a rails application, developers frequently encounter very similar types of problems, i.e. setting up a database, changing the name of a column or seeding a database. Luckily, Rails has several built in commands / helpers that allow us to implement repetitive command line tasks into a single command.  

The `rails` command is frequently used to...
* Create the database - `rails db:create`
* Create and edit database tables - `rails db:migrate`
* Drop the database - `rails db:drop`
* Seed the database - `rails db:seed`

> [Learn more about the `rails` command here.](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html).

## You Do: Models (10 minutes / 0:20)

> 5 minutes exercise. 5 minutes review.

In the `app/models` directory of your Rails application, create files for your `Artist` and `Song` models the [same way you did in last week's Active Record class](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/activerecord-intro#defining-our-models). They should...
* Have the appropriate file name
* Have the appropriate model name
* Inherit from `ApplicationRecord` (look in `app/models/application_record.rb` to see where `ApplicationRecord` connects to `ActiveRecord::Base`)
* Indicate the appropriate relationships. This app will follow the below ERD...

![tunr erd here](https://i.imgur.com/JzWriwJ.png)

How do you know it worked? If we hop into the rails console and type in Artist...  

```bash
$ rails c
```

You should then see something like...  

```text
Loading development environment (Rails 5.0.1)
2.2.3 :001> Artist
 => Artist(Table doesn't exist)
```
> If we type in any other capitalized word it will throw an error `uninitialized Constant`  
>  
> The console may respond by telling you to enter `Artist.connection` or `Song.connection`. Go ahead and type that in, then continue to test.  

## We Do: Migrations (15 minutes / 0:35)

At the end of the last exercise, we got an error in the Rails console telling us that a table did not yet exist. Let's take care of that with migrations...  

Think of a set of migrations as a recipe for a database schema, with each migration representing a step in that recipe.
* Our schema file defines the structure of our application's database
* A schema starts off with nothing in it, and each migration modifies it to add/remove tables, columns or entries
* ActiveRecord knows how to update your schema along this timeline, bringing it from whatever point it is in the history to the latest version
* ActiveRecord will update `db/schema.rb` to match the latest database structure

> An extensive description of Rails migrations can be found via the Rails docs [here](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html).  

In the terminal...

```bash
$ rails g migration create_artists
```

> `rails g` is short for `rails generate`.  
>
> Note the title we gave our migration file. Here we've indicated that we're creating a table called `artists`. The two words are separated by an underscore. This is a rails convention.  

This creates a migration file `db/migrate/20150726145027_create_artists.rb`. Let's see what it looks like...  

The numbers at the beginning of a migration file are a timestamp.
* Rails uses this timestamp to determine which migration should be run and in what order. If you're copying a migration from another application or generate a file yourself, be aware of its position in the order.  

> [Source](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html#creating-a-migration)  

```rb
class CreateArtists < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :artists do |t|
    end
  end
end
```

The above file, as is, defines a new table called `artists`. Now we need to define what columns are going to appear in this table. We'll do this inside of the `create_table` method...

```rb
class CreateArtists < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :artists do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.string :photo_url
      t.string :nationality
    end
  end
end
```

How are we defining columns in `create_table`?
* We use `t` to indicate the table we are creating inside of the code block.
* We then use methods like `.string` or `.integer` to represent the data types of the columns we are creating.
* These methods take in a symbol argument (e.g., `:photo_url`) that represents the name of the column.

>
> For more on using the `change` method, click [here](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html#using-the-change-method)  

To run this migration and create the `artists` table, enter the following into the terminal...

```bash
$ rails db:migrate
```

After running this, a file called `db/schema.rb` is generated. What are its contents?

> You should **NEVER** have to update the `schema.rb`. Running `rails db:migrate` will update the schema for you using migration files.  

## You Do: View `db/schema.rb` (5 minutes / 0:40)

> 2 minutes exercise. 3 minutes review.

Read through this new file.

## You Do: Use Rails Console (5 minutes / 0:45)

> 2 minutes exercise. 3 minutes review.

Enter the Rails console -- `rails c` -- and create two Artists using Active Record methods.

## You Do: Songs Migration (10 minutes / 0:55)

> 5 minutes exercise. 5 minutes review.

Create a migration file for a new `songs` table. Songs should have columns for `title` `album` and `preview_url`, all of which are strings.  

To associate one model with another in a migration file, you can include one of the following methods in the `create_table` method. They all do the same thing assuming you have set up your associations properly in your models...  
* `t.references :artist`
* `t.belongs_to :artist`
* `t.integer :artist_id`
> Note: `t.references` or `t.belongs_to` (which are aliases of each other) are preferable because they set up indexing of records (faster querying)

## Break (10 minutes / 1:05)

## Passing Arguments Into `rails g migration` (10 minutes / 1:15)

We can use the Terminal to create an entire migration file -- column names and data types included -- in one command...

```
$ rails g migration create_songs title:string album:string preview_url:string artist:references
```
> There are lots of little shortcuts that `g` or `generate` can give you. [Model Generators](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html#model-generators) are just one example.  

The above command creates the following file...  

```rb
# db/migrate/20150726150324_create_songs.rb

class CreateSongs < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :songs do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.string :album
      t.string :preview_url
      t.references :artist, foreign_key: true
    end
  end
end
```

What do we see?
* `references` is used when the column represents a foreign key for another table. It appears
wherever `belongs_to` appears in the model definition.
* `t.references :artist` is functionally equivalent to `t.integer :artist_id`
* `foreign_key: true` can be used with `t.references` or `t.belongs_to` to set up a foreign key constraint in our database. The above example, in SQL, it would translate to:
  ```sql
    artist_id INTEGER REFERENCES artists(id)
  ```


## You Do: Rails Console (5 minutes / 1:20)

> 2 minutes exercise. 3 minutes review.

Use Rails Console to create at least three songs that are associated with the previous two artists. Don't forget to migrate first!.

## We Do: Seeds (10 minutes / 1:30)

Seeds allow us to quickly create dummy data. Why would we do that?
* In order to test out the interfaces and functionalities we build out, we need some content/data to manipulate in order to see how it looks and feels on our application.

Let's update our seeds in `db/seeds.rb`.
* Write out the same Active Record commands you used in the Rails Console to create three Artists and three Songs.
* Make sure to include the following two lines of code at the very top of your `db/seeds.rb`...

```rb
Song.destroy_all
Artist.destroy_all
```

To execute the contents of `db/seeds.rb` all we need to do is run `$ rails db:seed` in the Terminal.

After running the seeds, go into the `rails console` and play with the objects you created.  

> Here's some [sample seed data](https://gist.github.com/amaseda/54223fc96f914500ff15) if you need it.  

## We Do: Adding Timestamps (10 minutes / 1:40)

Rails can automatically timestamp when objects are created and updated. Letâ€™s create a new migration to add timestamp columns to the artists table...

```bash
$ rails g migration add_timestamps_to_artists
```

In that migration place the following content...

```rb
# 20150726150946_add_timestamps_to_artists.rb
class AddTimestampsToArtists < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :artists, :created_at, :datetime
    add_column :artists, :updated_at, :datetime
  end
end
```

`add_column`. **What's that?**
* It's one of many custom methods that can be used in the `change` method in migrations
* It takes 3 arguments
  1. The table you want to add the column to
  2. The column you'd like to add to that table
  3. The column's data type

## You Do: Add Timestamps to the Songs Table (5 minutes / 1:45)

> 3 minutes exercise. 2 minutes review.

Apply what we just learned to the `songs` table.

## Undoing Things

### The Wrong Way (10 minutes / 1:55)

Lets assume you have this migration...

```rb
class CreateArtists < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :artists do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.string :poto_url
      t.string :nationality
    end
  end
end
```

We really messed this migration up by misspelling `:photo_url`. But oh no, we've already run our migrations! What do we do?  

We could directly modify this migration file and run `rails db:migrate`.
* But if we then look at `db/schema.rb`, however, we see that nothing has changed. It still says `poto_url`.

What about resetting the entire database via the Terminal?  

```bash
$ rails db:drop
$ rails db:create
$ rails db:migrate
```

If we run these commands, we're dropping our entire database and creating a brand new one.
* Why is this potentially super dangerous?

Another way we can do this is by using `rails db:rollback`.
* To undo a single migration, run `rails db:rollback` in the Terminal
* Be careful though -- this might destroy data! Whatever columns or tables that were created by that migration will now be gone.  

> Running `rails db:rollback` will only undo the migration with the most recent timestamp. Every subsequent rollback will undo the most recent timestamped migration that hasn't been undone yet.  

It is considered okay to rollback migrations, edit them and re-migrate in a development environment, but **NOT** in a production environment.
* If you are working on an application with other developers, avoid using `rails db:rollback` after code has been pushed

A common theme here is that if you're not working alone in development, destroying data is bad.
* It's sometimes not obvious what actions you take may or may not destroy user data. Know that `rails db:rollback` and `rails db:drop` have the potential of doing it.

### You Do: Create a Migration and Roll It Back (5 minutes / 2:00)

* Create a migration that adds a column to artist called `genre` that has a string as the data type
* Run the migrations by running `$ rails db:migrate`
* Inspect `db/schema.rb` and look at its contents
* Now run `rails db:rollback`
* Inspect `db/schema.rb` again and note that `genre` is not longer a column in the table
* Spend two minutes experimenting for yourself how `$ rails db:rollback` works


### The Right Way (10 minutes / 2:10)

Let's assume we did mess up our initial migration like the code above with the misspelled `poto_url`. Instead of the methods listed above, the right way is to create an additional migration that changes the name of the column in our table.  

In the terminal...  

```bash
$ rails g migration change_column_in_artists
```

This will generate a new migration. Lets fill its contents now in `db/migrate/20161105201357_change_column_in_artists.rb`...

```rb
class ChangeColumnInArtists < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    rename_column :artists, :poto_url, :photo_url
  end
end
```

`rename_column` is another method we can use inside `change`. It takes 3 arguments...
  1. The table for which you want to rename a column.  
  2. The current name of the column you'd like to change.  
  3. The new name of the column.  

Now if we run our migrations, we can see that the artists table in `db/schema.rb` has the proper `:photo_url` column. Although this process takes a bit more legwork, we don't run the risk of destroying databases or undoing migrations.

## Validations (10 minutes / 2:20)

ActiveRecord is pretty great for allowing us to easily read from and write to our database. But sometimes power and simplicity just allows us to more easily shoot ourselves in the foot.

In the rails console (`$ rails c`), lets try some code:

```ruby
billy = Artist.first
puts billy.name
# Billy Joel

billy.name = nil
billy.save

puts Artist.first.name
# nil
```

Every `Artist` *__should__* have a string for their name, but ActiveRecord just let us erase it. If only we could have our model enforce rules on our properties to prevent us from leaving important properties blank.

##### Introducing `validates`.

Much like the relationship keywords `belongs_to` and `has_many`, ActiveRecord provides us with a keyword `validates` to enforce rules on our model's properties.

Lets add this to our `Artist` model:

```ruby
# tunr/app/models/artist.rb

class Artist < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :songs
    validates :name, :nationality, {presence: true}
end
```

* This `validates` keyword tells ActiveRecord we want to enforce a rule on some of this model's properties
* It takes 2 or more arguments
  1. one or more properties you want to enforce
  2. a hash with:
     * the validation helper name as a key
     * its option(s) as the value

In this case, we're telling ActiveRecord to validate `name` and `nationality` to always be present (not nil or empty-string)

Plenty of more validation helpers:
* `length` - enforces rules on the length of a string

  ```ruby
  validates :name, length: { minimum: 2 }

  validates :password, length: { in: 6..20 }
  ```
* `numericality` - enforces rules on for a numeric value

  ```ruby
  validates :height, numericality: true

  validates :points, numericality: { only_integer: true }

  validates :age, numericality: { greater_than: 21 }
  ```
* [and many more](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#validation-helpers)

 > Remember: `validates` works for **models only**. Don't try to add `validates` to a database migration.
