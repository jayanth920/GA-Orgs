## Welcome & Today's Schedule

### Intro

Welcome to your first day of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive! We'll start off by having your instructors introduce themselves. Each instructor will tell you:

- Name
- Preferred Pronoun
- What they were doing before joining GA

After that, we'll give you an overview of the schedule for the first day. 

**Today's Schedule:**

* 9:45 - 10:00 - Icebreaker
* 10:00 - 11:00 - What is an Immersive Course?
* 11:00 - 11:10 - Break
* 11:10 - 11:20 - Letters from former WDI Instructors
* 11:30 - 12:00 - Course content overview
* 12:00 - 12:30 - Entire cohort meets Production, Outcomes & Campus staff
* 12:30 - 1:30 - Lunch
* 1:30 - 2:30 - Instructor AMA
* 2:30 - 5:00 - First Lesson

## Icebreaker

First, let's do some introductions!

For the icebreaker, you'll pair up with the person sitting next to you. Get a white board marker from one of the instructors and find some space on the whiteboard walls.

Start by introducing yourself: what is your name? What brought you to GA?Diversity and inclusion are really important to us here at General Assembly. So when you introduce yourself, you should feel free to provide your preferred pronouns.

Once you've finished your introductions, create a mind map of your partner! Your mind map should have your partner's name in the center and drawings of the things they like on the left side and drawings of the things they dislike on the right side.

## What Is an Immersive Course?

Spend two minutes discussing some answers to the following question: **What does it mean to be in an "immersive" environment?**

### There's no winning or losing.

* This is a non-competitive environment.
* You get out what you put in.
* Everyone enters and leaves at different levels. Try to compare you with you only.
* Use your classmates' work as inspiration to improve your own!

### Cooperation.

* You'll be learning, eating, growing, failing, and succeeding **together** for the next 12 weeks.

### Re-learning how to learn.

* The most significant skill you will gain from this course is not proficiency in a particular web framework or programming language, but rather learning how to teach yourself
* You will learn this in an environment that is specifically tailored to this goal, where there is heavy support, instruction designed to structure your self-learning process, and safety to 'fail'.
* We will progressively "back off" over the course of the cohort, encouraging the development of your autonomy as a developer, allowing you to stand strong on your own.

### You will be uncomfortable. Regularly.

* Don't be too hard on yourself.
* You will probably feel somewhat lost on this week's topic, feel more comfortable with last week lessons, and notice that a few weeks ago looks easy.

### Productive Struggle.

* The pace of this course is designed to push you past your limits.
* The brain is like a muscle; sometimes it gets sore.
* Struggling with the material doesn't mean you aren't learning; on the contrary, it reflects sustained and meaningful engagement with the material.

### Embrace failure.

* Here we learn by doing, and things don't always (and usually won't) go right the first time.
* This is normal. Expect it.
* Fail often and learn from it.

### Nothing is Magic.

* "Magic is indistinguishable from any sufficiently advanced technology"
  _-Arthur C Clarke_
* Humans have reached a considerable degree of technological sophistication, there are so many places where we can begin to discover how a technology works, how the technology developed, how the technology is put together, what problem does the technology solve (or what does it make it easier to do?) etc.
* 'The Programmer's Mindset' will come with time, but it begins with the question, "How is this working?"

> Nothing above is specific to coding, but is true of learning in general.

### Balance.

* This intensity means that we have to make room for balance.
* Sleep, food, hydration, rest, and hygiene.

### We will not give up on you.

* Even when you might have given up on yourself!
* None of the instructors are here just to collect a paycheck. We're passionate about web development, education, your interests, and your professional and personal growth.

### Trust that our decisions are informed by solid experience.

* We have a large body of knowledge, experience, and expertise to draw on from the iterative nature of WDI; WDI has been through 20 iterations.
* Each iteration of WDI has been driven in part by student feedback, and for that reason, we rely on your feedback. Please don't hesitate to provide us with feedback!

### We are here to navigate, you are here to drive.

* We will teach every lesson as best we can, but if you don't pay attention then there's no point.
* Past students have said, "this program works if you do" and that is 100% true.
* We will navigate you through the process of becoming a junior web developer but you have to do the peddling.

## Growth Mindset

[Growth Mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_oqghnxBmY_) -
[Dr. Carol Dweck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck)

This may be the most mentally challenging thing you've ever done - the first time you've been bad at something in a long time. You will fail and struggle at times, but that's important. We don't succeed despite challenges - we succeed because of challenges.

* Unfortunately, this can hurt. Just like exercise can make you sore and tired, so should learning. Try to enjoy the burn knowing it is making you better.
* We anticipate that you will run into hardships. When you do, that's when it is time to really challenge yourself and buckle down. Don't quit! Embrace the fact that the challenge will make you a better coder. Endure the struggle to grow and develop your mind.

### The Emotional Cycle of Change

![Emotional Cycle of Change](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/3c/f4/fa/3cf4faeb2078f4f4fbb9265444bde2e0.jpg)

Programming is a mindset. It's about confidence and being open to failure. It's about knowing when to climb from the bottom of the cycle and being able to say, "Eh, I'm going to try this thing, even though I don't really understand it. AND I'm not going to get attached to it in case it doesn't work and I have to erase all my code and try something completely different."

The growth mindset here is understanding that even when something doesn't work, it will still make you a better coder! We want this to be challenging for you because...

* Just memorizing stuff won't help you. Learning HOW to code will.
* You can't BS your way through code.
* The fundamental standard of programming: It either works, or it doesn't. No amount of sweet-talking will make it work.
* Google is your best friend

Throughout the course of WDI many students say something along the lines of "I don't know how to do that." Many of you certainly will. If you do, however, just add "...yet" to the end of that sentence.

## How to Ask for Help?

Asking for help is what students find hardest in WDI. It is also what ultimately determines whether or not students will be successful in this class.

* Without fail, the students who do not ask for help do the poorest in the class.
* **Knowing how to ask for help and where to look for answers** are two of the biggest skills you can gain from this class and will be incredibly valuable as you prepare to join the professional workforce.

How can we ask for help efficiently?

* Ask a clear problem. "I don't know any of this" isn't a clear problem. "I tried this thing and got this error" is a clear problem.
* Your instructors and peers won't be able to help you if...
  * The question you're asking isn't constructive
  * It's clear you haven't made an effort to find the answer. This means taking the following steps...
    1. First, try it yourself
    1. Then, Google it
    1. Then, ask your neighbor
    1. Finally, ask an instructor

### Gradual Release of Responsibility

Being able to ask for help effectively will become increasingly crucial as the course progresses. During the first project, for example, we will be holding office hours throughout the dedicated project days. By the fourth project, however, all support will be conducted using Github issues. Between those two projects, instructors will be placing an increasing onus on the students to solve problems on their own with increasingly limited instructor support -- what we call a "gradual release of responsibility."

While instructors love helping out, we've found that students become stronger developers by learning to solve their own problems. Your instructors won't be following you to your jobs so it's important to develop a sense of self-sufficiency while you're here.

## Break

## Letters from Previous WDI

At the end of the past few cohorts, we've asked students to write letters to future students. They include inspiration and tips on how to make the most of your time here.

## Course Content

GA's global team has built a baseline curriculum, which includes topics to cover and a suggested order. As a local campus, we have built on and modified this curriculum based on our own experiences as instructors and the unique features of the DC job market. Each lesson is designed by the instructor that's delivering it.

We also iterate on this curriculum constantly so technologies and concepts change with each cohort.

## Course Content

> What are some technologies and languages you know of that are involved in web development (e.g., HTML, CSS, Python, Databases).

A non-exhaustive list of technologies we cover...

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Python
* Django
* PostgreSQL (Relational Database)
* MongoDB (NoSQL Database)
* Node.js
* Express.js
* React.js

We cover these technologies / topics because they are foundational to web development, and learning the underlying concepts of how they work prepares you to learn and work in any web development technologies.

### Course Sequence

The course is divided into 4 units lasting roughtly 3 weeks each. Each unit concludes with a 3-5 day project.

## Units/Projects

### Unit 1

## Course Logistics

### Weekly Schedule

#### Normal Weeks

Weekdays

* **9:00-10:00**: Checkpoint / Code Challenge / Review / Mini-lesson
* **10:00-12:30**: Lesson 1 / Lab / Outcomes (Tuesday)
* **12:30-1:30**: Lunch
* **1:30-2:30**: Flex Time / Study Hall / Work Time (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday)
* **2:30-5:00**: Lesson 2 / Lab

#### Project Weeks (3, 6, 8, 12)

Project weeks will be pretty much just time for you to work on your project.

* There will be no scheduled lessons (outcomes will meet as usual)
* There will be no evening office hours, since instructors will be widely available during the day.

### Instructor Communication

The Instructors are here for you and to help you succeed, but we can't be available to you you 24/7. There will be dedicated time for instructors to provide students with in-person support outside of lessons. These are:

* **Study Hall**: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday - 1:30PM - 2:30PM
* **Lab support**
* **Project support**

These are times when instructors are available to help you with bugs, answer questions or provide advice. The goal of this program is to turn you in to a self-sufficient web developer, so our expectation is that you try to resolve issues on your own as much as possible. We use the remaining time to prepare lessons, grade projects, etc.

However, if you have any questions concerning WDI, your progress in the course, challenges you are facing, or any other **non-technical** concerns that you would like to discuss, you are welcome to Slack instructors to set up one-on-one meetings. If you reach out via Slack in the evening, the instructor will probably respond by the next day.

### Graduation Requirements

The WDI Graduation Requirements are [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DC-WDI/WDI21/blob/master/graduation-requirements.md).

### Homework

The WDI Homework policy is [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DC-WDI/WDI22/blob/master/homework-policy.md).

### Attendance

The WDI Attendance policy is [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DC-WDI/WDI22/blob/master/attendance.md).

### Plagiarism

The WDI Plagiarism policy is [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DC-WDI/WDI22/blob/master/plagiarism.md).

General Assembly is not a traditional educational institution, but we share some things in common. We have a plagiarism policy in place to create a healthy classroom culture where students prioritize their learning above all other goals for the duration of the cohort. We create a space where it is 'safe to fail' since 'failure' is such an integral part of the learning process.

* You can't ask external people to do your work
* You must understand your submissions -- if you can't explain them then the assumption is that you plagiarized
* If you collaborate, you have to indicate that you did in a comment on the submission
* You have to comment where you have used the solution branch (if one exists) or if you have used an external resource such as a tutorial

## Classroom Constitution

## Administrative Checks / Student Agreements

* Update GitHub and GHE Profile
	* Username should be your full name (first and last name)
	* Profile image should be an image of you where we can see your face
* Sign Requirements Agreement and set goals
* Review Code of Conduct
* Run installfest (if you couldn't make an installfest before launch)
