## Framing
( 5 minutes / 0:05 )

Code Reviews are a common practice among many development teams and something that you as a future developer should become comfortable with. In this lesson, we'll go over the goals of a code review before conducting our own on Project 1.

## Code Reviews
( 10 minutes / 0:15 )

Before explaining what a code review is, here are the general goals of a code review:
- make everyone on the team aware of the new code being added to the codebase and how it works
- help everyone on the team improve as a developer
- ensure every new feature deployed to production is written in the most maintainable way possible
- make sure all code is well documented
- catch any bugs or possible edge cases before they're introduced to production

A code review will typically take place once you have completed a project or feature and are almost ready to deploy it to production. That said, it's not uncommon for teams to do scheduled code reviews as a project progresses. During a code review, you will demo the feature or project you're working on and the code you've written so far in building it out. The other members of your team will then provide feedback and advice.

**The most important goal of any code review should be improving the code.**

## Deliverables
You should leave your code review(s) today with a list of changes and improvements you can make to your project.

## Tips for having a good code review

1. Don't get personal! Don't get defensive! **Everyone** can improve as a developer and benefit from a code review. The goal is to help you improve your code by having someone else look over it.
2. Review the right things! Is the code well structured? Is it readable? Those are the kinds of questions you should ask and answer. Not, is it how I would have solved the problem?
3. Adopt a growth mindset. The goal is to help identify specific ways for you to improve the code.

## You Do: Code Review
( 45 minutes / 1:00 )

The class will pair up to give and receive a code review for about 10 minutes each. Decide amongst yourself who will receive a code review first. Then, work through each set of the following questions as part of your review.

**Setup and Overview** ( 2-5 minutes )

- What was the project you were trying to build, in your own words?
- How did you break the problem down in to smaller parts?
- What were the key features of your MVP? Why?
- What was the biggest challenge you faced working on this project?

**Problem Solution** ( 2-5 minutes )

- What is the overall architecture or structure of your code base?
- What are the key classes/functions? Why did you decide on these? What is each one doing?
- What pieces of functionality are missing or incomplete in your project? What are the next steps to finishing them?

**Bugs and Tweaks** ( 2-5 minutes )

- Are there any bugs still in the project? What might be causing them? How might they be fixed?
- Are there parts of the code base that could be cleaned up so that they're easier to read and understand what is happening?
- Are there pieces of commented out code left in the codebase?
