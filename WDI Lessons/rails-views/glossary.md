# Views and Controllers Glossary

#### Controller
> A collection of methods telling your Rails app how it should respond to each type of request.

#### `ApplicationController`
> Every controller inherits from ApplicationController, similar to how every ActiveRecord model inherits from `ActiveRecord::Base`. The first line in any controller file will always be `class SomethingController < ApplicationController`.

#### Controller method
> One of the methods that tells your Rails app how it should respond to a specific type of request.

#### Action
> Another name for controller method.

#### Route
> A HTTP verb and path. In Rails, these are mapped to a controller action (in the form of `"controller#action"`).

#### View
> The presentation of data from your model (data that comes through the controller). The view is rendered in to HTML by Rails and send to the user in response to their request.

#### `.html.erb`
> Like a regular HTML file, except you can put Ruby code snippets in it.

#### `ERB`
> Embedded Ruby -- Ruby code that's run from inside an HTML file

#### `<% some_code %>`
> aka "Clown Hats". ERB syntax for executing Ruby code that is not output in to HTML.

#### `<%= some_code %>`
> A code snippet that Ruby runs **and then** makes the result show up in your HTML, visible to your users.

#### `$ rails routes`
> A Rails CLI command that displays all the routes for your app.

#### `render`
> A method that tells a controller action if it should show a `.html.erb` and if so which one, or show JSON or plain text.

#### `redirect to:`
> A method that tells a controller action to redirect to a different URL instead of rendering a view.

#### Implicit rendering
> Controller actions by default look for views that have their name: `def wombat` will automatically render `wombat.html.erb` even if you don't include `render`.

#### Form
> An HTML tag that allows data to be submitted from a webpage.

#### `params`
> A hash of key/value pairs that are included with every request you make. It can include data from the request's URL (`/users/bilbo_baggins`), data from a URL query string (`?name=bilbo%20baggins`) or data submitted using a form.

#### Strong params
> A method that allows only specific key/value pairs in `params` to be sent to your controller actions, for security purposes.

#### Partial
> A piece of `.html.erb` code that can be inserted into other `.html.erb` code.

#### `form_for @something do |f|`
> Generates an HTML `form` element for you.

#### `f.text_field :some_field`
> Generates an HTML `input` element for you such that, when you submit the form, `some_field: user_input` is one of the key/value pairs included in `params`.

#### `f.label :some_field`
> Generates an HTML `label` element for you such that, when you click on it, the `some_field` `input` element is highlighted.

#### `f.submit "My button text"`
> Generates a button that, when clicked, submits the data the user entered into the `form` and loads the URL to which the data was sent.

#### GET
> A type of HTTP request that is conventionally used only to *retrieve and read* data, not to *send and change* data.

#### POST
> A type of HTTP request that is conventionally used to *send and change* data.

#### `index` route
> Conventional name for a route used to display multiple records of a certain class (e.g. multiple users)

#### `show` route
> Conventional name for a route used to display a single record of a certain class (e.g. one user)

#### `new` route
> Conventional name for a route used to display the `form` to create a new record of a certain class (e.g. a "Sign Up" page for users)

#### `edit` route
> Conventional name for a route used to display the `form` to update an existing record of a certain class (e.g. "Edit your profile" page for users)
