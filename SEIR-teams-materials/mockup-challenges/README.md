# Mockup Challenges

The best way to learn CSS is to use it! This repo is a collection of mockup challenges. You'll be provided with a mockup, or high-fidelity image that a designer has originated for a given application. Your goal is to use HTML and CSS to recreate that image on a static application, as close to pixel-perfect as possible!

> Building out mockups is a common technical challenge when applying to frontend/fullstack positions! Like any other skill, the more you practice, the better you'll get at it. After building out a mockup, ask for feedback from classmates, family or friends -- a second pair of eyes might catch a discrepancy you missed!

## Instructions

1. Each folder in this repository contains a README with specific directions and an image for the mockup. In some instances basic HTML and CSS have been provided.
1. Use your HTML and CSS skills to build out the static application for each mockup.
1. Consider hand-drawing a wireframe of the page layout first to plan out your approach to the layout.

## Suggested Order (in increasing complexity):

The challenges are listed in order of increasing layout and styling complexity below. However, feel free to jump around and work on the mockups that pose the most interesting styling challenges to you!

In general, focus on achieving the overall layout, sizing, and positioning of elements first. Try to find similar fonts and colors (hint: use your Mac's built-in digital color meter tool to quickly find the RGB/Hexadecimal colors), but don't spend too much time on the minutiae.
