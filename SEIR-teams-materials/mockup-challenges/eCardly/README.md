# eCardly

![](screenshot-final.png)

#### Prerequisites

- HTML & CSS

---

## Deliverables

`index.html` and `styles.css` files that try to recreate the eCardly mockup as best as you can. The images you'll need are in the `images` directory inside this eCardly folder.

<details><summary><strong>Hints</strong></summary><p>

### Body

- The `<body>` should have a background of the background.jpg provided for you in the images folder. The image should repeat only going left and right. The rest of the page should have a background of #d6d6d6.

  - Hint: define the background image repeating in only one direction AND the background color on the same line.

- The `<body>` has a default font of Helvetica with font size of 12px.

- Define a line height for the body of 1.7. This gives every line of text .35 padding above and below it.

### Links (`<a>` tags)

- Links on the page should be red (#ff3300) and not be underlined.
