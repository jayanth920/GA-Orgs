# JavaScript Checkpoint

## Before You Start
1. Download this repo to your `sei/labs` folder. `git clone [url]`
2. Navigate into this repo. `cd checkpoint-javascript/`
3. Open this repo in your text editor. `code .`
4. Have your terminal and browser open side by side. (Use Spectable to arrange windows quickly!)

**Before you begin anything, from this repository, run `npm install` in terminal.**

> This will install all the Node package modules needed for this exercise. You should already have installed Node.js during Install-Fest, and Node automatically installs the `npm` command and functionality. 

## Instructions

This checkpoint is divided into three sections with different topics. The suggested order is as follows:

1. Fundamentals in `fundamentals.js`
2. Higher-order Functions in `hof.js`
3. Object Oriented JavaScript in `oojs.js`

Each section has a series of prompts written in inline-comments. Write the JavaScript necessary to complete each prompt in each of the three files. **DO NOT** modify any of the comments or the tests may fail.

Your goal is to get as many tests as possible to PASS during this hour!

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Make sure to use the `var` keyword for **ALL** variable declarations (for testing purposes). **DO NOT** use `const` or `let`.

- **DO NOT** modify the files in the `/test/` folder.

## How to Run Tests

To run the tests in the terminal, run `npm test`. Every time you make a change and save your files, you will need to manually re-run the tests. When you start, all of the tests will be failing; your goal is to make as many pass as you can in the hour provided.

> HINT: read the output of the failing tests.
