# GitHub Profile Readmes

As a developer, your presence on GitHub is a significant indication of who you are and what you're interested in. From the projects you create to the code you contribute, to the stacks and languages you prefer, a potential employer can tell a lot about you as a dev from your GitHub profile. 

Showing activity on GitHub through your projects for this course, your Hack Week contributions, and your 100 Days of Code, has already built your momentum on GitHub. Today we will work on creating a Profile Readme to further enhance your GitHub presence and help you get a head start on your post-course job hunt.

## Why Profile Readmes

The importance of a developer portfolio is a topic of discussion in the dev community. A good portfolio can enhance your online presence, but a poorly designed portfolio can detract from it. For the Outcomes portion of the course, you will be working on a developer portfolio, but creating a GitHub profile Readme can stand in for your portfolio while you're building and refining it.

GitHub profile readmes were implemented in 2020 as a new GitHub profile feature. You can read the docs on them [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme). Think of your GitHub profile as your personal website -- you get to showcase who you are as a developer, highlight your accomplishments, and invite others to connect with you.

## Creating a GH Profile Readme

### Step 1: Create a new repo
To begin, navigate to your personal GitHub profile. Click the `+` icon in the upper right-hand corner of the interface and create a new repository. 

**Important** When you create a new repo, you must name it the EXACT same way that your username is written!

When you enter in your username as it's written, a special message pops up that says you've unlocked GitHub Profile Readmes! :scream:

### Step 2: Edit your markdown

Once your new repo is created, you can click the "edit" pencil icon in the righthand corner to start building your Profile!

The Profile Readme comes with some commented out Markdown code that offers you a place to start. The sky is the limit here -- there are tons of plugins, badges, and even GitHub actions you can incorporate to make your Profile stand out.

### Hero Image

Use a design tool like Canva to create a banner image on your Readme! 

### Use HTML

Remember that GitHub Readmes support HTML, so you can use HTML elements if and when needed. For example, to center a heading, you could use this in your Readme: 

```html
<h3 align=center>Hello World, it's me!</h3>
```

**Output:**
<h3 align=center>Hello World, it's me!</h3>


### GitHub Actions

If you want to automatically link your blog posts or Tweets, you can use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to write a script!

### Keep Exploring

There are so many amazing features to add, such as Spotify "Now Playing" badges and GIFs. Make your GitHub profile representative of your brand and interests as a developer!
