# Sorting Review & Insertion Sort

## Instructions 

1. Fork this repo to your own account and download to your `sei/sandbox` folder.
1. Follow along the steps in this README to progress through the myGA modules.
1. Submit an issue demonstrating your understanding when you are finished.
1. We will work on the insertion sort implementation in the morning! 

## Overview

This lesson is a review of the concept of sorting in computer science, the comparison sort, as well as an introduction to insertion sorts.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this assignment, you will be able to:

- Describe the time and space complexities of bubble and insertion sorts.
- Implement bubble and insertion sorts.

## Prerequisites

- Big O Notation

## Activity 

There are two components to this lesson, in the following order:

1. [myGA module: Basic Sorting Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/778) - starting at Slide 10 for Insertion Sort (feel free to go to previous modules to review concepts such as comparison sorts, Big O and stability). 
1. Exercise: Write an Insertion Sort Algorithm (save for tomorrow morning!)

To do this in class exercise, you can either...

1. Work in the `insertionsort.js` file in this folder in VS Code on your computer and test your output in the console
1. Use [this CodePen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/xMeqaN?editors=0010#0) provided by the myGA Basic Sorting Algorithms module, which has built-in testing. This CodePen includes bubble sort from our previous lesson -- focus on the insertion sort (second code block)
