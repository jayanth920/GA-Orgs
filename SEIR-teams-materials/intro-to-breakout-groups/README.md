# Intro to Breakout Groups

You will be spending a lot of time together with your cohort mates collaborating within Zoom breakout rooms in this program. Breakout rooms will allow you to work on labs and and other group activities (e.g., discussions) in a smaller, more collaborative environment.

Another important goal for breakout rooms is to help our engineers develop their soft skills. As an engineer, a significant part of your time will be spent working with other engineers, so while technical skills-building is important in this program, it's equally important to hone your people and communication skills. Being an engineer that other engineers are delighted to work with would make a candidate more employable. 

## Breakout Room Etiquette
Let's follow a few basic rules to ensure an optimal breakout room experience for everybody.

- Be on camera at all times, and contribute.

- Keep your microphone on mute if you're not talking, as ambient noises can be distracting.

- Keep the amount of personal rants/conversations to a minimum. We understand it's important for you all to socialize and get to know your cohort mates but we want you to focus on coding first and foremost! Let's leave the socializing to after class.

- One person should be sharing their screen at all times, but that person is not solely responsible for coming up with the solutions. Everyone should be participating in the breakout rooms.

- Take turns sharing screen (e.g., rotate every 15 minutes for shorter labs and 30 minutes for longer labs).

- The breakout group should attempt to ***work at more or less the same pace.*** Be proactive about asking for help/clarification from others in your group if you're falling behind. Offer help if you're way ahead!

- If a classmate's solution does not make sense, ask for clarification. This will not only benefit you but will also give your classmate the opportunity to practice their technical communication skills.

- Designate a presenter from your breakout group to be ready to share a summary of the group's discussion.

- Respond to polls in the classroom Slack channel in a timely manner. The instructors will send out a Slack poll and regularly (every 30 minutes or so) prompt you to let us know which part of the lab you're working on. We use this information to pace the class accordingly so we absolutely need your participation in the polls to craft an optimal learning experience!

- Stay in your breakout groups even if you're done early! Offer your knowledge to help out your fellow engineers. The instructors will close out the breakout groups when we're ready.



## Instructor Support During Breakout Sessions
- Typically, instructors will rotate through breakout rooms to see how our engineers are doing.

- If your group is stuck on an issue, feel free to DM one of the instructors and one of us will swing by your breakout room to help out. Remember the problem solving process we talked about in orientation: try solving the problem on your own first. If that does not work out, try googling for a solution. Still stumped? Ask a cohort mate! If that still does not result in a clear solution, reach out to an instructor.


# Mini Lab - Classroom Constitution

- Work with your classmates to come up with a list Do's and Don't's that you believe would make for good classroom etiquette.

- Check out the previous cohort's [Classroom Constitution](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-921/course-intro/blob/master/constitution.md) for some inspiration.

- We'll come back as a group before lunch to create our own cohort's constitution.
