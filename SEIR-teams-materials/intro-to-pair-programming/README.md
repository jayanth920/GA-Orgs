# Introduction to Pair Programming

## Instructions

1. Review the information below, and watch the three videos on pair programming. 
1. Submit an issue to this repo answering the exit ticket questions in the issue template. 

Unless otherwise noted, homework is due the next day at 10 am ET. 

## Check to see if Node/NPM are installed

We will need Node and NPM (Node Package Manager) installed beginning tomorrow for our React unit. To check if they are installed, please follow these directions: 

1. In your terminal from any directory, run `node --version` to check what version of Node is installed on your machine.
1. Then run `npm --version` to see what version of NPM is installed. 
1. If you see version numbers as outputs from both commands, you are all set for tomorrow! Note the version numbers for the first exit ticket question.
1. If you do not see version numbers, refer back to the [Installfest repo](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-921/installfest/blob/master/node.md) and run the commands to install Node and NPM. 

## Preview tomorrow's lecture

Watch this short [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3AkSS5hXMA) introducing React.

### The What
Pair Programming is an [Agile](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/) software development approach to coding, where two developers work together on the same code. The typical division of labor involves one developer working as the Driver and writing the code, while the other developer is the Navigator and provides direction and feedback. Roles are periodically reversed during a pair programming session, so that both developers take turns as the Driver and Navigator. 

### The Why
Beginning in this unit, our engineers will have the chance to practice this development approach, as we move into partner assignments and group projects so that we better understand what it means to work on development teams and with other engineers. 

### The How
In person, pair programming occurs on the same computer. In remote settings, pair programming can be accomplished by screen sharing and with the help of extensions like Live Share for VS Code, that allow two programmers to work in the same project simultaneously. 

## Let's Dive Deeper

#### Consider the following questions as you watch the videos below: 

1. What might be some advantages to pair programming? 
1. Why might pair programming increase output and productivity on development teams? 
1. What could be some potential drawbacks and antipatterns to watch out for?
