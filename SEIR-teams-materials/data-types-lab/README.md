# Just The Beginning

Let's get some practice with the JavaScript fundamentals!

#### Prerequisites

- Terminal
- JavaScript 

---

## Getting Started - Terminal

1. Open Terminal

1. Navigate to your Documents directory `/User/username/Documents`

1. Make a directory inside Documents called `w1d2_lab`

1. Go into the `w1d2_lab` directory

1. Inside `w1d2_lab`, make a file called `first_lab.js`

1. Open the `w1d2_lab` directory in your text editor.

1. Write the answers to the rest of this lab in the `first_lab.js` file.

1. Make sure you are in the same directory as the file, otherwise it won't run.

1. Press the up arrow to retrieve the `node first_lab.js` command. That way, you don't have to type it each time to run the file.

## Errors 

**Fix the code by following the errors in Terminal**

Cut and paste the following code into your text editor (the "Cheers" song lyrics). The code is broken -- there are **three errors**. You might already see the errors, but --

Run the code and read the error message in the terminal. Using information from the error message (line numbers, etc.), debug the code and make it work.

At the same time, write a comment below the code that specifies what _type_ of error it was. Example, if you get this:

Write

```
// SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
```

Cut and paste:

```javascript
console.log("Making your way in the world today takes everything you've got.");
console.log("Taking a break from all your worries, sure would help a lot.");
console.log("Wouldn't you like to get away?");
console.log("Sometimes you want to go");
console.log("Where everybody knows your name,");
console.lo("and they're always glad you came.");
console.log("You wanna be where you can see,";
console.log("our troubles are all the same");
console.log("You wanna be where" "everybody knows");
console.log("Your name.");
```

Make it so you do not get any more errors!

## Boolean Expressions 
*... and arithmetic*

By just looking at the following expressions, determine in your mind whether or not each will evaluate to **true** or **false**

1. `999 > 999`
2. `999 == 999`
3. `999 != 999`
4. `-5 >= -4`
5. `100 <= -100`
6. `20 + 5 < 5`
7. `81 / 9 == 9`
8. `9 != 8 + 1`

## Assignment Operator vs. Equality Operator 

Write: What is the difference between:

the **assignment operator** `=`

and the **equality operator** `==`

## Conclusion

Congrats, you finished the lab! There is no need to submit this lab.
