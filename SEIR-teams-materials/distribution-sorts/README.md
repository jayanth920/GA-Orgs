# Distribution Sorts

## Overview
This lesson covers two sorting algorithms that use the distribution sort method: bucket sort and radix sort. This is different than the other sorting algorithms we've met so far, which use the comparison sorting method.

## Homework Instructions

1. If desired, fork this repo to your own account and/or clone down locally to your machine.
1. Work through the exercises listed below. 
1. When finished, submit an issue answering the exit ticket questions to summarize your learnings on this topic.

Unless otherwise stated, homework is due by 10:00 am ET the next day. 

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Explain how bucket sort and radix sort work.
- Identify scenarios in which bucket sort and radix sort should be used.
- Describe the time complexity of bucket sort.
- Implement bucket sort.

## Prerequisites
* Big O Notation
* Intro to Sorting Algorithms
* Basic Sorting Algorithms

## Activity

There are two components to this lesson, in the following order: 
1. myGA module: [Distribution Sorting Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/802)
2. [In-Class Exercise: Implementing Bucket Sort](./exercises/BucketSort.js)

**To do the in class exercises, you can either...**

1. Fork and clone this repository to your local machine and work in the relevant files
1. Use [this codepen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/RdwpEJ?editors=0010#0) provided by the myGA Distribution Sorts module
1. Regardless of which way you choose, the exercises are the exact same

## Additional Resources
- A [nice visualization](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BucketSort.html) of bucket sort.
- A [similar visualization](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/RadixSort.html) for radix sort.
- Check out how [radix sort is implemented](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/algorithms/sorting/radix-sort), as we won't cover it in the lesson.
