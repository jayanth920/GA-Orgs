# Code. Every. Day.

The idea here is <b>consistency</b>. If you can commit to coding for at least one hour every day, you will be an expert in your craft within five years. Not just good, an expert. You've heard us say it before, it's about the reps. The more time you spend coding, the faster you will gain that deeper understanding.

 There are many thousands of people just like you that want to learn software development and want to make the transition into tech. All of the material that we have shown you is available for free somewhere on the internet. People come to General Assembly for the structure and the discipline.

 Up to this point, you have had your instructors and your peers to lean on, on an almost every day basis. Soon this course will be over and you will have to find ways to keep yourself focused and motivated outside of the classroom atmosphere while you are on the job hunt.

 We've designed this outline to help you stay focused and to help you get your name out there in the tech industry. Everyone starts somewhere, and if you don't already have an online presence in tech, then you're about to.

 Putting yourself out there feels uneasy, especially when you are getting started. We are going to take the first step to building our network so you have momentum upon leaving the course.



# 100 Days of Code

- [100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) is a challenge for software developers and a movement.
- Developers who commit to this challenge are committing to coding for at least one hour for the next one hundred days.
- After doing something coding related - *solving a challenge on CodeWars, teaching yourself something new, completing a tutorial, building your own project, or contributing to open source* - you are going to tweet about it on Twitter.
- Today is day one of your challenge. With this you commit every day to <b>practicing, networking, and building your brand</b>


# GitHub Heat Map
- You may have noticed your Heat Map lighting up on days where you have made at least one commit.
- We're going to make sure our GitHub's are painted green


## Instructions


1. Make an account on [Twitter](https://twitter.com]) for your presence in tech. This will serve as a professional account that you can and should add to your resume.
1. For now, you do not have to add a profile picture, but you should have your handle include your name. Ex: jdoe_codes
1. Follow popular topics in programming like JS, React, Node, Python, etc.
1. Follow as many people in the space as you can find. The idea is to expose your feed to as many voices in tech as possible. Your feed will connect you to even more people and topics to follow.
1. Next, follow the other people in your breakout room. Then follow everyone in the class. This is your first network in tech and as you all branch off and excel in your careers you will want to stay connected.

1. Now, go to your personal GitHub and make a new repository named code-every-day. Clone it and open it in your text editor

1. Go [here](./log.md), view the file in its raw form and copy the contents. Put it in a file called `log.md`. Change Day 0 to reflect that today you are signing up.

1. Complete a challenge on Codewars. Give yourself an easy win so you can post about it on Twitter. Make another file in your repo where you can solve the coding challenge and make a commit. Then add your success to the `log.md` to track your days and progress through the challenge.

1. Push your work to your GitHub and Tweet about your progress using the hashtags #100DaysOfCode and #codeEveryDay. This will make your post visible to anyone else searching the challenge and will get more eyes on your post.


Today, you will tweet that you have accepted the #100DaysOfCode challenge, and every day for the rest of the course you will document one thing that you learned or worked on that day. 

### Deliverables
- Every morning for the rest of the course you will be required to submit links to your GitHub repo as well as the link to your tweet.
- This is in addition to the daily HW assignments.
