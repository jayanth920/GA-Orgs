# Project Choices

## Flash-Cards

Pre-load your app with some data, and let the user flip through them quickly
(back or front), and use the keyboard flip the card, and to mark whether they
got it right or not. Track which cards were incorrect, and re-display them until
the user gets them right!

_Bonus:_

- Track scores over time (even if the page is reloaded)
- Include images on one or both sides of the flash card
- Let the user add flash cards (don't need to be saved across refreshes)

## Self-scoring Trivia

Pre-load your app with some questions and answers.

Test the user's wits & knowledge with whatever-the-heck you know about (so you
can actually win). Guess answers, have the computer tell you how right you are!

_Bonus:_

- Add time-based scoring
- Track scores across games (even if the page is reloaded)
- Allow users to compete against each other on a high-score board.

## Spaceman

Have a player enter a word that will be guessed during the game. The word is
then hidden and represented by blank spaces. The second player then chooses
letters, which are revealed if present. If not, parts of the spaceman's spaceship are built. For an example, see [this video](https://videopress.com/v/Fk5cYswc). (Note, there are many variations on this game, including Parachute and Snowman -- feel free to get creative here!)

_Bonus:_

- Add timer-based scoring
- Track scores across games (even if the page is reloaded)

## Tower of Hanoi

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi">Tower of Hanoi</a> is a
mathematical puzzle where the objective is to move a stack of discs from one rod
to another. There are three rules:

- Only one disk can be moved at a time
- Every move involves taking the top disk from one of the stacks and placing it
  on top of another stack
- No disk can be put on top of a smaller disk

_Bonus:_

- Add time-based scoring
- Track scores across games (even if the page is reloaded)

## Simon

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_">Simon</a> is a test of memory.
Have your program choose a sequence of different colors at random and then
prompt your player repeat the sequence allowing them to go to advance to next
round if the player is successful.

_Bonus:_

- Add timer-based scoring
- Track scores across games (even if the page is reloaded)
