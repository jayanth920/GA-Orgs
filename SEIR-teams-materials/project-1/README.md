# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project #1: Build a Game with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

For your first project, you'll be creating a familiar game using HTML, CSS and
JS! Please choose one of the following options:

- **[Flash Cards](project_choices.md#flash-cards)**
- **[Trivia (Self-scoring)](project_choices.md#self-scoring-trivia)**
- **[Spaceman](project_choices.md#spaceman)**
- **[Tower of Hanoi](project_choices.md#tower-of-hanoi)**
- **[Simon](project_choices.md#simon)**

This is an opportunity to **be creative**, and work through some **tough
programming challenges**.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you
along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

> If you want to choose a different game for Project #1, please consult with an
> instructor! Warning - many seemingly simple games end up being much more
> complex than you might think!

## Requirements

### Project Proposal

Create an issue in this repo using the [**Project Proposal** issue template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-201/project-1/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=proposal.md&title=Your+Name+-+Your+Squad+Lead) and submit it before the proposal submission deadline.  Make sure you complete **all of the prompts**.  Use the example proposal found [here](project_proposal_example.md) as a guide. 

Your proposal will be reviewed by your squad lead who will communicate feedback with you directly.

### Project Requirements

Your app must:

- Render in the browser
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
- Be deployed online using [Github Project pages](https://pages.github.com).
- Use semantic, valid markup for HTML and CSS (must pass validation without errors)
- Show a good commit history with frequent commits (minimum of one commit per project day)

#### Required Deliverables

This is your project checklist.  Make sure to revisit it before you submit your project! Your submission must include **all** of the following:

- A game, built by you, hosted on Github Pages
- Your HTML/CSS should pass the [HTML5 Validator](https://html5.validator.nu)
  and [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- Your JavaScript should be cleanly formatted (use Prettier!) and not contain any console.logs (you can search for them with command + F [or ctrl + F on Windows/Ubuntu] and then remove them or comment them out).
- A git repository hosted on Github with frequent commits dating back to the
  very beginning of the project (**at least one commit is required per day of the project**).
- A `README.md` file that includes the following sections:
  - [ ] An embedded screenshot of the app
  - [ ] List of the **Technologies used**
  - [ ] **Installation instructions**
  - [ ] Your **User stories** – who are your users, what do they want
        and why?
  - [ ] Your **Wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in
        your application
  - [ ] Descriptions of any **Unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had
        to overcome
- A link to your hosted project in the URL section of your Github repo.

### Project Submission

**_DO NOT FORK THIS REPOSITORY!_** Create a **new** repository on your PERSONAL GitHub account (not GitHub Enterprise). Then, submit your project as an issue to [the project 1 gallery repository](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-201/project1-gallery).

You must turn in something before presentations begin. However, you're welcome
to continue working on it over the course of SEIR and beyond!

With your submission please include any questions you'd like answered, or
specific things on which you'd like us to focus when giving feedback.

Once you've submitted your project, make sure to visit your fellow cohort mates' projects.  Leave them some encouraging words or ask them about some code they wrote in the comments of their issue!

### Project Presentations

It is a common practice on development teams to have a demo day every two weeks at the end of each development cycle (known as a sprint or iteration). On demo day, teams meet to share what they've accomplished during the current sprint.  

To prepare you for this, for project 1, you will give a demo of your project to your squad.  Each person will be given approximately 5-10 minutes to demonstrate their project, talk about some part of their code that they are particularly proud of, share their experiences working on the project, and answer questions from squad members.  

You must present your project at this time, even if you did not complete the requirements.  If you do not show up for project presentations, your project will not be deemed as submitted and you will not be eligible for graduation.  

During presentations, there should be **no working on your code** while others are presenting. This is your
chance to ask others how they tackled their project.

Be prepared to answer questions like:

- What would you do differently?
- What are you most proud of?
- What would you do next?
- How did you plan your project?
- What did you learn?


## Project Week Format

- No daily attendance on Zoom required **except for morning exercises & Outcomes attendance**. If you’re absent for morning exercises or Outcomes that will count as a full day absence, so please show up!
- You **do not** need to submit any exit tickets during project week 
- You are required to communicate with your squad lead **daily**!  This may be in the form of a [daily stand up](https://geekbot.com/blog/daily-standup-meeting/?k_id=dsa-910872033553&adgroup_id=96910465570&campaign_name_ad=10071775578&gclid=CjwKCAjwzvX7BRAeEiwAsXExo25ZchZ9JOgDt-esFT0qW6Dj36sgBtYkCHLhf-NPH4W7Cw1rKiWhkxoCXVUQAvD_BwE) or Slack check in.  Your squad lead will provide more details.
- Projects must be submitted to the [gallery (via an issue)](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-201/project-1-gallery/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=project-submission.md&title=YOUR+FULL+NAME) by Thursday 2/25 at 12:00 pm ET.
- Project presentations will be begin at 1:00 pm ET on Thursday 2/25.  You must present your project at this time.  If you do not show up for project presentations, your project will not be deemed as submitted and you will not be eligible for graduation.
- Office hours can be found on Slack.

## Recommendations for Success

- Create a [bronze, silver, and gold plan](https://github.com/ga-wdi-lessons/bronze-silver-gold).  This is your first project and you don't have a good way to estimate how long individual tasks will take, so it's better to set the bar low.  There's no problem with under-promising and over-delivering!  You can always add more features if time allows. However, if you focus on non-MVP features before your MVP is complete and run out of time, your submission will not satisfy the project requirements.
- **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation,
  views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually.
  Use a whiteboard or notebook to capture your thoughts!
- **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc)
  to debug and solve problems
- **Don't under estimate the value of planning!** Use tools like [Trello](https://trello.com/en-US) or [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/features/project-management/) and track your progress against milestones.  Don't think of the working game as the goal.  Think of the next milestone as the goal (e.g., getting my click handler to work, or getting the UI implemented).  This will feel far less overwhelming and each successfully completed milestone will provide you with the motivation to tackle the next task!
- **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you
  can always go back in time to a previous version.
- **Make it work, make it good, make it fast.** Don't get hung up on only saving
  or writing code that is good code. Get it working first, even if it means
  writing bad or ugly code. Once it's working, come back and refactor!
- **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, etc.) to better
  understand what you’ll be getting into.
- **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.**
  Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real
  data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to
  change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose
  game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

## Getting Help

### Office Hours Appointments

Instructors will be hosting office hours between 11:00 to 1:00pm ET and 2:00 to 4:00pm ET
each day of project week. The regular weekend office hours will also be available.
Check the course schedule for more information.

> The purpose of this project is for you to show us and future employers what
> you're capable of, so we want as much of the project to be your own,
> independent work as possible. 

### Github Issues

We strongly encourage you to file a [Github issue in this repository](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-201/project-1/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md&title=YOUR+NAME+-+BUG+DESCRIPTION) prior to asking the instructors
for help directly. 

Having to articulate the question into words is very helpful in understanding the problem. Sometimes, simply articulating the question gives you the answer. 

More importantly, submitting issues, creating bug reports, and posting questions about code on platforms like stackoverflow.com is something you will do ***regularly*** when you're employed in the industry.  Learning how to communicate about your code errors and issues is an essential skill that takes practice to get good at doing effectively and succinctly.

## Plagiarism

Take a moment to re-familiarize yourself with the [plagiarism policy](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-201/course-intro/blob/master/plagiarism.md).  

Projects give you an opportunity to apply the skills you're learning in a practical manner.  If you're struggling with something, that's okay!  In fact, that's why you're here -- if this was easy and you could do it already, you wouldn't be here. These assignments are similar to those you can expect when applying for a job,
either in the form of a take-home coding challenge or an in-person technical
interview. So lean in, get comfortable with being uncomfortable, and challenge
yourself to complete this project on your own.
