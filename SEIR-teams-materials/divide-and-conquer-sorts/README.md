# Divide-and-Conquer Sorts

## Overview
This lesson covers two sorting algorithms that use the "divide-and-conquer" method: merge sort and quick sort.

## Homework Instructions

When you have finished the module, submit an issue on this repository to summarize your learnings on the topic. 

**There are two separate issue templates, one for Merge Sort and one for Quick Sort! Be sure to submit the issue with the correct template for the sorting algo at hand.**

Unless otherwise noted, homework is due by 10 am ET the next day. 

Save the coding portion of the assignment for the next morning! 

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this two-part lesson, you will be able to:
- Describe how to use merge sort and quick sort to sort data.
- Explain the space and time complexities of merge sort and quick sort.
- Identify when to use merge sort or quick sort in a given scenario.

## Prerequisites
* Big O Notation
* Recursion
* Intro to Sorting
* Basic Sorting Algorithms


## Merge Sort 

1. [myGA module: Divide-and-Conquer Sorting Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/882) (stop after slide 9)
2. [In-Class Exercise: Implementing Merge Sort](./exercises/MergeSort.js) (or use the [CodePen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/MxWpQW))

## Quick Sort 

1. [myGA module: Divide-and-Conquer Sorting Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/882) (start at slide 10)
1. [In-Class Exercise: Implementing Quick Sort](./exercises/QuickSort.js) (or use the [CodePen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/MxWpQW))

**To do the in class exercises, you can either...**

1. Fork and clone this repository to your local machine and work in the relevant files.
1. Use [the CodePen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/MxWpQW) provided by the myGA Divide and Conquer module.

>Regardless of which way you choose, the exercises are the exact same!

## Additional Resources
* A deep [dive](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/javascript-merge-sort-3205891ac060) into Merge Sort and an example of how to implement it in JavaScript.
* Check out [this visualization](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ComparisonSort.html) for both merge sort and quick sort.
* Revisit our folk-dancing friends, now showing [merge sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaqR3G_NVoo) and [quick sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywWBy6J5gz8&list=PLuE79vNc5Wi6q34LsQcaJ7ISQ8uOyMaL_&index=4).
* [This tool](http://me.dt.in.th/page/Quicksort/) is useful for understanding how quick sort works.
* Watch how these algorithms look sketched out for [merge sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzeBrDU-JaY) and [quick sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COk73cpQbFQ&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwKedT2KfDMB9YA5DgASZb3U&index=8&t=0s).
