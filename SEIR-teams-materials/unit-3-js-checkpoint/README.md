# Midcourse JS Checkpoint ‚úÖ

Congratulations on completing the first half of SEI! üéâ ü•Ç

As we learn more about backend development and NodeJS, let's keep our JavaScript essentials in excellent shape. These exercises will asses your skills in accessing and manipulating deeply nested data and returning a desired output, which we will continue to do throughout Unit 3 as we learn to build APIs and MERN applications.

## Set Up

1. Fork and clone this directory to your sandbox. Cd into it and checkout a dev branch.
1. Run `npm i` within the directory to install necessary dependencies.
1. Open this repo in your text editor with your `code .` command.
1. Run `node filename.js` to see the output of any console.logs as you code in specific files.
1. Run `npm test` to see if your code passes the tests and the outputs of any failing tests.

## Instructions

- Write the JavaScript necessary to complete each prompt.
- Your goal is to get as many tests as possible to pass! ‚è≤Ô∏è
- Use the `var` keyword for all variable declarations (for testing purposes only).
- For prompts that use array methods, you may use multiple array methods and properties to achieve the desired output. 
- Do not modify the files in the `/test/` folder.

Unless otherwise stated, homework is due the next class day at 10 am ET. 

### Requirements

- Your tests must run without errors. If there are errors that you cannot solve, comment them out and explain what you think is going wrong. 
- Tests for at least 8 out of 11 prompts must pass in order for your submission to be considered complete. 

### Suggested Order

1. Accessing and manipulating "X-Files"-themed data in complex objects and arrays in `objects.js` üëΩ

## Hungry for More

Check out [Slips](https://ga-dc.github.io/slips/), [CodeWars](https://codewars.com) or [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). These are great resources to test your development knowledge and prep for technical interviews!
