# Intro to Sorting Algorithms Homework

## Instructions 

1. Fork this repo to your own account and download to your `sei/homework` folder.
1. Follow along the steps in this README to progress through the myGA modules.
1. Do not work on the CodePen/JavaScript implementation of Bubble Sort yet. We will work on that in the morning. 
1. When you are finished, submit your assignment by clicking on the issues tab above on this repo and start a new issue. 
1. The issue template will ask that you answer three exit ticket questions before submitting your issue, to summarize your learning on this topic.

Unless otherwise noted, homework is due at 10:00 AM ET the next day. 

## Overview

This lesson is an introduction to the concept of sorting in computer science,
including sorting methods, stability, and how Big O comes into play for sorting.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this assignment, you will be able to:

- Define the two sorting methods and when you’d use each.
- Identify whether a sort is stable or unstable, and what impact that can have.
- Explain how Big O complexity applies to sorting algorithms.

## Prerequisites

- Big O Notation

## Activity 

There are a few components to this lesson, in the following order:

1. [myGA module: Intro to Sorting Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/818) -- tonight's homework
1. [myGA module: Basic Sorting Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/778) -- tonight's homework through slide 10 (we'll save Insertion sort for another time)
2. [Exercise: Try to Write a Bubble Sort Algorithm](./bubblesort.js) -- tomorrow's morning exercise
  - To do this in class exercise, you can either...
    1. Work in the `bubblesort.js` file in this folder in VS Code on your computer
    1. Use [this codepen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/xMeqaN?editors=0010#0) provided by the myGA Basic Sorting Algorithms module, which has built-in testing
      - Note this includes insertion sort as well, but unless you finish bubble sort, don't worry about doing that section today!
