# Search Algorithms

## Overview

This lesson covers an introduction to the concept of Search Algorithms. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Understand the Big O complexities of brute force and binary search approaches.
-   Describe how binary search works.
-   Write a binary search algorithm to find a value in an array.

## Prerequisites

-   Introduction to Computer Science
-   Big O
-   Sorting Algorithms

## Activity

To learn more about search algorithms, there are two components to this lesson, which should be done in the following order:

1. myGA module: [Search Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/633)
1. In-Class Exercise: Implementing a Binary Search

To do the in-class exercise, you can either...

1. Fork and clone this repository to your local machine and work in the relevant files.
2. Use [this codepen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/aMbWQj?editors=0010#0) provided by the myGA Search Algorithms module. (Includes the benefit of a test script.)
