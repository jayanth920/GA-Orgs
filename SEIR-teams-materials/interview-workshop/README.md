# Interview Workshop

Let's practice our interviewing skills!

Interviewing for your first developer job can seem like a really daunting
process: it'll be different for every job and you'll have to think on your toes
a lot.

That said, it's üíØ percent learnable!

Think about it like this: you are a problem solver. The process of interviewing
and getting your first developer is a problem. Approach it the same way you
would approach one of your projects or a challenging lab: break it down into
smaller parts, work on each part individually, and don't let yourself get
frustrated!

This workshop will help!


## Getting the most out of this workshop

The more seriously you and your group take this, the more you will all get out
of it.

We're role playing the interview process, which will help you feel more
comfortable when you're in an actual interview. When you are acting as an
interviewer, it's best not to interject or comment on how you solve a problem.
Instead, take notes. When you are the candidate, treat your interviewers as if
they were actually interviewing you for a job and not your fellow students. As the timekeeper, enforce the time limitations so that everyone gets a chance to participate, and observe the candidate's responses to provide feedback. 

## Mock Interview Lab

### Creating Your 30 second Pitch (~5 MINUTES):

First, lead with a strong introduction: ‚ÄúHi, my name is <name> and I‚Äôm a software developer who has expertise in ...‚Äù No need to emphasize that you just graduated from a coding bootcamp. In fact, no need to bring it up unless the interviewer asks about it.
  
Next, bring up your specific coding accomplishments in your pitch. You can talk about projects that you built recently (and bring up any interesting technical challenges you solved).

Then, explain your past experience briefly (e.g., previously I was an analyst at a healthcare policy consulting firm).

Finally, explain why you‚Äôre an exceptional fit for the role (e.g., I think I‚Äôm the perfect fit for this role because ...)

Make sure your response is about 30 seconds - 1 minute at most. Here is a [good article](https://www.interviewcake.com/behavioral-questions-programming-interview-story-telling?course=fc1&section=interview-tips) on how to tackle behavioral programming interview questions. 

### Mock Interview Script

First, in your breakout room, take some time in your breakout groups to read through and get comfortable with the script below.
Next, whenever everybody in the group is ready, take turns interviewing each other. In each interview round, designate a person to play these roles:

- Interviewer (DON‚ÄôT FORGET YOUR POKER FACE)
- Candidate
- Timekeeper

If you‚Äôre an observer in the interview, think about how you would answer the questions if you were the candidate. Jot down what you think the candidate did well and what the candidate could improve on. Share your feedback with the candidate when the interview is over in the form of Glows ‚ú® and Grows üí™.

By the end of the afternoon, every student in the breakout room should have had a chance to be the candidate at least once.

Here‚Äôs the script for the interviewer to follow:

#### Intro (~1 minute)
Interviewer: ‚ÄúHi, my name is (say your name!). How are you? I‚Äôm your interviewer at General Assembly. We are really excited that you‚Äôre applying for an engineering role on our team. Just a bit of intro about myself [then introduce yourself in 20s or less]. This interview will last for about 45 minutes. We will begin with some questions about your background and projects, followed by questions and coding challenges on JavaScript/Python. Then we will spend about 35 minutes working on an algorithms problem. Does that sound good? Any questions before we get started?‚Äù
  
#### Behavioral (7 minutes)
Interviewer: ‚ÄúTell me about yourself‚Äù. 

After the interviewee's pitch, pick and ask a few questions from [this markdown](./lib/behavioral.md). 

Stop whenever 7 minutes have elapsed.

#### Rapid-Fire Questions (5 minutes)

Interviewer: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs move on to some questions about JavaScript and React.‚Äù

Pick and ask a few questions from the following categories:

- Front-End questions [here](./lib/front-end.md)
- Back-End questions [here](./lib/back-end.md)

#### Code Challenges (10 minutes)

Interviewer: ‚ÄúFor the next section, we will work through a few code challenges in JavaScript/Python. There will be some code in the code editor and I‚Äôll like you to take a moment to read through the code and think about what would happen if we run the code without actually running it, and then explain to me your thought process using your understanding of JavaScript concepts. The first question is‚Ä¶‚Äù

Pick and ask 3-4 questions from [here](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/interview-questions). 

Stop whenever 10 minutes have elapsed.

#### Algorithms (allot 10 minutes for the mock interview, but typically you‚Äôre given 45 minutes for this section)

Interviewer: ‚ÄúNext, we will work on an algorithms problem. We will have 10 minutes for this section. [present the problem] Please feel free to ask me if you have any questions about the problem. Also, please take some time to think through the problem and briefly your approach before you start writing code.‚Äù
If the candidate solves the problem or when you are close to the end of the interview (~5 minutes before the end of the interview), ask the candidate to describe the time complexity and space complexity of his/her solution in terms of Big O notation.

Stop whenever 10 minutes have elapsed.

Pick a coding challenge from the course schedule that you worked on in the past that you feel comfortable presenting to the candidate, or a challenge from a code challenge platform like CodeWars or Leet Code.

[Coderpad.io](https://coderpad.io) is a great tool for sharing code during this part of the interview.

#### Conclusion

‚ÄúOur time is up. Thank you so much for your time! It was really nice to meet you. Once we‚Äôve wrapped up here, my team will follow up with you in the next couple of days for the next steps.‚Äù

#### Feedback (5 minutes)
The interviewer and the candidate and the rest of the breakout room should discuss how the interview went, as well as offer the candidate their strengths and suggestions for improvement!

## Algorithm Challenge Five-Step Process

As the interviewee, follow the steps below during your Algorithm challenge. 

#### Step 1: Clarify + Test Cases ~ (5 minutes)

Take a few minutes to understand the problem BEFORE WRITING ANY CODE. Also, ask the interviewer the following questions:
What are the expected input/output formats?
Are there any constraints on space and runtime? What are we optimizing for?
Can you consult documentation without being penalized?
Does your code have to compile and run for your solution to be considered complete? Or do you just need pseudocode?

Any edge cases (e.g., duplicate strings, empty strings, uppercase vs lowercase) to be aware of? Jot them down quickly along with other test cases.

#### Step 2: Solve (3-5minutes)

Describe your algorithm, at a high level, to your interviewer and get their feedback. Bounce ideas off of your interviewer. They want to know what it‚Äôs like to problem-solve and brainstorm ideas with you! No need to go into detail on the specifics of your implementation (e.g., I will use a forEach function...). Don‚Äôt proceed to the next step unless you have a clear algorithm in mind that you will implement or the interviewer says they are fine with your solution. 

#### Step 3: Code

If your algorithm is lengthy, then consider pseudocoding first. As you are writing out your code, consider testing your code by running it in the console regularly so you can catch bugs early on, if any. 

#### Step 4: Verify your Draft Solution

Once you have a draft of your code written down, test your code against all the test cases you wrote down in Step 1. If you find any bugs, make sure to go back and fix your code.

If you are whiteboarding, then walk through your code on the whiteboard line by line, testing with the sample inputs and test cases you‚Äôve written down earlier.

#### Step 5: Improve/Refactor your Working Solution

Based on what the interviewer wants, either refactor your code (e.g., separate large chunks of code into their own helper methods) or make it more optimal (i.e., think of a different data structure/algorithm that could improve the efficiency of your implementation).

## Additional Practice

### [1. Whiteboarding](lib/whiteboarding.md)

The whiteboarding section will provide you with prompts which you will answer on a white board. Your code does not have to be
perfect!

### [2. Behavioral](lib/behavioral.md)

Behavioral interview questions are commonly used as an icebreaker and to get to
know you, the candidate. Your goal is to have relatively canned answers to these
questions.

### [3. Code Challenge](lib/code-challenge.md)

Solving a code challenge in front of other people is nerve wracking at first! Practice makes it much more doable. 

### [4. Front End](lib/front-end.md)

Can you answer these front-end trivia questions?

### [5. Back End](lib/back-end.md)

Can you answer these back-end trivia questions?
