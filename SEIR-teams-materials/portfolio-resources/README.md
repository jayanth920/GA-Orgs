# Developer Portfolio Resources üé®
Tips and resources for creating your developer portfolio! 

## Getting Started with Technologiesüíª

Think about what your favorite technologies have been in the course, and areas you'd like to keep growing in. Use vanilla JS, HTML and CSS if you'd like, or continue building on your React skills by building a website with it. If you're curious about learning a new framework, consider something like GatsbyJS. 

Check out this [article](https://austincodingacademy.com/blog/web-development/what-are-companies-looking-for-in-a-web-developers-portfolio/) to get a sense of what employers look for in developer portfolios.

## Content & Design üñºÔ∏è 

The most important thing is to have a portfolio up and running. It should be easy to use and highlight your personal brand. Think about what you want potential employers to know about you from visiting your site. Make the most important content prominent and easy to find. 

A great approach to design is to first wireframe your website. You don't have to be a designer to create an attractive, user-friendly website. Revisit our UX/UI [quick guide](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-921/intro-to-UX-UI-design) for a refresher. 

Consider how you're going to execute the design of your portfolio. If you have a strong vision and feel confident in your ability to execute the CSS professionally and effectively, go for it! If you'd feel more comfortable using a framework like Bootstrap or Material UI, those are great options too. 

Start small with a landing page, then think about how you can continue to build on it as needed by incorporating projects, etc. 

Don't forget finishing touches, like making sure the document's meta title tag reflects your site's name and adding a [favicon](https://favicon.io/).

## GitHub üò∏

A super easy way to get started with deploying and hosting your website is to deploy your app on GitHub pages. If you name your repository `your-username.github.io`, you can access the site at `https://your-username.github.io`. 

If you'd like to go a step further, consider buying a domain name on a site like NameCheap or other domain name marketplaces, and configuring your GitHub Page with a custom domain name. See the documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).

## Final Tips üîñ

Don't let perfect be the enemy of good. It's more important to get something out there so that you can dive into Outcomes and job apps post-course. Just like any project, focus on getting an MVP done. 

Be sure to get feedback from your fellow devs, friends and family on your portfolio design and usability. If you have a designer friend, now is the time to ask their opinion on your site!
