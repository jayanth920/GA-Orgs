# Sets

Sets are a simple, nifty little data structure. They're similar to arrays with one key difference: They only hold unique values.

## Homework Instructions 

Complete the activity as outlined below. When you are finished, submit an an issue answering the exit ticket questions to summarize your learning on this topic! 

Unless otherwise stated, homework is due by 10:00 am ET the next morning.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Define a set and how itâ€™s used in programming. 
- Distinguish between a set, an array, and a linked list. 
- Implement a set and common methods used in sets.

## Prerequisites
* Big O Notation
* Linked Lists

## Activity 

There are two components to this lesson:
1. myGA module: [Sets](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/465)
2. In-Class Exercise: [Implementing a Set](/exercises)

**To do the in class exercises, you can either...**

1. Fork and clone this repository to your local machine and work in the relevant files
1. Use [this codepen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/gEOeZW) provided by the myGA Sets module
1. Regardless of which way you choose, the exercises are the same
