# UI Challenge React

You've made it through the phone screen and had a great chat with the technical lead at the organization you're applying for! They'd like you to complete a technical assessment to show your programming chops. 

This assignment is based on a real technical assessment that was given for a frontend developer interview. In the real world scenario, the developer would be given about a week to work on this and submit their code for review. Depending on the organization and who you're interviewing with, they might give you some feedback and ask you to implement those changes as well.  

## Objectives: 

- Developers will be able to see a real-world technical assessment for a frontend role. 
- Developers will be able to digest the challenge and ask clarifying questions.
- Developers will be able to build an application that meets the MVP requirements for the challenge.

## Prerequisites: 

- CSS & Responsive Design
- React Components & State
- Semantic & Accessible Forms
- Error Handling
- Unit Testing

## Task:

Develop a simple login page using AngularJS or **ReactJS**. The mockup from the design team is below:

The logo asset is available [here](https://media.git.generalassemb.ly/user/21811/files/546c2880-af58-11ec-917c-d9bd1e9dbecd). 

The sans-serif font is Open Sans and the serif font is Roboto Slab. Both are available from Google Fonts. The blue accent color is rgb(88,153,223).
