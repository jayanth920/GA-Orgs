# Graphs

In this lesson, we will cover the basics of the node-based data structures known as Graphs. Graphs are your favorite data structure that you (maybe) didn’t even know about. They power social media, maps, and more! We’ll also learn the basics of the graph data structure and how they’re implemented.

## Homework Instructions

Complete the activity as outlined below. When you are finished, submit an an issue answering the exit ticket questions to summarize your learning on this topic!

Unless otherwise stated, homework is due by 10:00 am ET the next morning.

## Learning Objectives

**Graphs:**

- Define a graph and understand the difference between undirected and directed graphs.
- Identify how graphs are used in programming.
- Implement a graph using an adjacency list.

## Prerequisites:

- Big O Notation
- Linked lists
- Binary Trees

## Activity

There are two components to this lesson:

1. myGA module on [Graphs](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/403)
1. In-class exercise implementing a Graph in JavaScript

**To do the in-class exercises, you can either...**

1. Fork and clone this repository to your local machine and work in the relevant files.
1. Use [this codepen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/JzjvvE?editors=0010#0) for the Graph exercise.
