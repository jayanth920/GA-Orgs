For Project 2, we will be shaking things up a little bit! Students will have 90 minutes this morning to prepare EITHER a short video demonstrating your project, or a draft of an article/blog post highlighting your project. (Feel free to do both the video and article at some point!)

### Why Deliverables? 

One of the most effective ways to make yourself known to the developer world is by building your online presence. As discussed in Outcomes, sharing your experiences coding and building projects not only lends insight into your technical understanding and thought processes as a developer, but also shows potential employers your mastery of a certain tech stack! 

It can be hard to take those first steps into the world of creating content, and this is a great way to ease into it. üòé 

## Deliverable Instructions

<details>
  <summary>Video Instructions</summary>

Prepare a short screencast (3-5 minutes) demonstrating your project, which you will upload to YouTube/Vimeo. Here's an [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrXoFgZTI64) made by an SEIR alum! 

### Warnings

- **Do not put your video in your Github repository**  since it'll be at least 500MB.
- **Record a quick test video first.** Otherwise you'll end up with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCukspxmNDs).
- **Make sure your microphone is turned on.** See previous comment.

### Requirements

Your video should be uploaded to YouTube, Vimeo or a similar service. **Please do not  put it in a Github repository** since it will probably be at least 500MB. **LinkedIn** also supports [video hosting](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/100983). 

If you have a Gmail account, you already have a YouTube account. Just go to https://www.youtube.com/dashboard.

**Your video could include...**

- ...your voice loud enough to be heard. Speak loudly and clearly when recording!
- ...a description and demo of your app
- ...a code sample explaining one thing you're proud of
- ...one thing you would do differently next time
- ...the next feature you would like to implement


## Recording a Video

You may use any video-recording mechanism you wish. Whichever you choose, we recommend that you **make a quick test video first**.

### QuickTime

QuickTime Player is in the Applications folder of your Mac. Notice that if you go to the "File" menu you can create a "New Screen Recording"! This collects audio as well; it's how instructors screencast lessons. You can then save your video to your computer and upload it to YouTube.

**Make sure you turn on the microphone before recording.**

### iMovie

If you're feeling really fancy you can use iMovie -- also in your Applications folder -- to swankify your video. However, having a snazzy-looking video isn't necessary!

### Online Applications

There are several online screen recording applications available, such as [Screencast](https://screencast-o-matic.com/). 

Use whichever technology feels most comfortable and intuitive for you!

  <summary>Article/Blogpost Instructions</summary>

## Preparing an article/blogpost

Write the draft of your article in Google Docs or a text editor. Be sure to check for any spelling/grammar errors, and have a classmate, friend, or family member proofread your article before publishing! Consider including screenshots of your application and/or code snippets to increase engagement. 

When your draft is finalized, publish it to LinkedIn, Medium or Dev.to to share your thoughts with the world! Be sure to include lots of hashtags, such as #coding, #learninginpublic, #javascript, #react, etc.

## Video/Article Key Points

The questions listed below should be a place to start for what could be covered in your deliverable. Feel free to improvise and add to the topics, and be sure to lend your own personality and flair to your video or article, in keeping with the personal brand you are building. 

### Introduction

- What's your app called?
- Why is it useful? What is your "pitch"?

### The Planning Process

- How did you arrive at this idea?
- What would you change about your planning process?

### Demonstrating Your App

- What are the integral features of your app?

### Demonstrating Your Code

- What was the most difficult part?
- What did you learn?
- What are you most proud of?

### Highs and Lows

- What worked well?
- What didn't?
- What features would you like to add?

## Project 2 Gallery

When your deliverable is ready, submit (or update) your issue on the Project 2 [Gallery](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-622/project2-gallery/issues) with the links to your deployed application, your GH repo, and your video and/or article. 

Later today, we will reconvene as a class and give everyone time to do a Gallery Walk and tour all the amazing Project 2 Applications and deliverables created by our classmates. Check out and get inspired by your classmates' work. You can leave emojis and comments on the issues, like on this [sample issue](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-622/project2-gallery/issues/1). Feel free to also leave feedback on the deliverable medium itself to show your support. Spread the GA love! ‚ù§Ô∏è
