# Functions Code Challenge!

Now that we have control flow and functions under our belt, let's try to see if we can come up with a series of algorithms that will allow us to solve a specific challenge.

If we flip a coin X times, what is the probability that the sequences of outcomes (for example, 'THHT', 'TTHT' etc.), will include a specific specific sequence (for example, 'HT')?

## You Want Me to do What?!

Perhaps some of you could do this if you focused for an hour, but we do not expect you to be able to solve this problem at this stage in your cohort. Instead, you will be provided with the pseudocode for this problem, and your job will be to convert the pseudocode into working code!

## Instructions
1. Fork and clone this repository
2. Change into the new directory
3. Install the dependencies with ``npm i``
4. Work on your solutions in the ``lib/challenge.js`` file
5. Check your work as you go with ``npx mocha``
