# Intro to CS/Algorithms & Big O Homework

Throughout this course, we will use a combination of myGA modules assigned as homework as well as in-class exercises to learn the fundamentals of computer science topics. 

For the myGA modules, focus on grasping the main ideas and larger concepts. The following morning, we will practice applying these ideas to code! 

## Instructions 

1. If desired, fork and clone this repo. 
1. Follow along the steps in this README to progress through the myGA modules.
1. When you are finished, submit your assignment by clicking on the issues tab above on this repo and start a [new issue](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-921/big-o-modules/issues/new). 
1. The issue template will ask that you answer several concept-based, code-free exit ticket questions before submitting your issue, to summarize your learning on this topic.

Tomorrow morning, we will dive deeper into our approach to CS in this course, algorithms, and Big O notation and use it to evaluate the efficiency of different code samples.

Unless otherwise noted, homework is due at 10:00 AM ET the next day. 

## Overview

There are three parts to this lesson:
1. [myGA module: Intro to Computer Science](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/513)
1. [myGA module: Intro to Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/780)
2. [myGA module: Big O Notation](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/511)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

**Intro to CS**

- Explain why understanding computer science can make you a better programmer.
- Describe how computer science appears in software engineering job interviews.

**Intro to Algos**
- Understand the role algorithms play in programming.
- Define the two classifications of algorithms and how theyâ€™re used.

**Big O Notation**
- Explain how Big O notation is used to describe algorithms.
- Define constant, linear, quadratic, logarithmic, and factorial Big O runtimes.
- Analyze algorithms to determine their Big O runtime.

## Prerequisites
- None
