# YUM!

For Homework you will be writing a node application to practice using Express, Mocha, Chai, and Supertest for automated testing. Your task: create an app that tracks and stores Restaurants.

**Due Thursday, 5/14 at 10 am EST**

## Setup

Fork and clone this repo. Build out your file structure following MVC and install all the necessary packages from npm.

Follow this simple [Git Paired Programming workflow](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-323/paired-homeworks.md/blob/master/README.md).

## Express API

 ***You must add automated tests for your API endpoints using Mocha/Chai***.


Your app should have one resource: Restaurants.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | String | The name of the restaurant |
| owner | String | The name of the owner |
| type | String | The type of food the restaurant serves |
| capacity | Number | The max capacity of the restaurant |
