During the last morning exercise, we built out the HTML for the VSSL mockup:

![vssl](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-826/MorningExercise_VSSL_pt1/blob/master/vssl_mockup/mockup.png)

This morning, we're going to work on styling it with CSS to make it look more like the mockup.

## Setup

1. You already created the HTML for this mockup last morning exercise. You should have it in a `MorningExercise_VSSL_pt1` folder. We called it `index.html`.
1. Continue working in yesterday's morning exercise folder OR copy your `index.html` file and `img` folder into today's folder using`cp` in Terminal
    - _NOTE:_ if you created more files than this (like a CSS file), you will also need to copy those files
1. Inside the vssl_mockup folder in today's (or yesterday's) morning exercise, create a `style.css` file. Make sure it's on the same level as your `index.html` file as well as the `img` folder and `mockup.png` file.
1. Inside your `index.html` file, link your `style.css`
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
   - You can check that your CSS is attached correctly by adding a background color to the page temporarily.  

## Activity

1. Your focus should be on positioning the content!
1. Save looking for fonts for last. You don't need the exact font - just choose something that looks similar.

## Resources

If you struggled making the html, we've included an sample_index.html for you to work off of in the vssl_mockup folder.
