# Functions Practice

The purpose of this exercise is to practice working with functions. Think of it
as doing reps or practicing scales! The more you practice, the better you'll
get.

## Prerequisites

- Fundamental JavaScript: syntax, data types, and arrays
- Conditions, including `if`, `if`/`else`, and `if`/`else if`/`else`
- Loops, both `for` loops and `while` loops
- Functions

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory and create a development branch.
1. Fulfill the listed requirements.

Starter code is available in [`lib/challenge.js`](lib/challenge.js). You are
required to turn in your submission by making a pull request on the original
repository.

**Make a commit after each prompt.**

Unless otherwise specified on the calendar or by an instructor, homework is due
the next morning by 10:00am ET.

### Preview Tomorrow's Content

When you are finished with this assignment, take a look at the following so that you're ready for tomorrow's lecture on JS Higher Order Functions & Array Methods.

- freeCodeCamp on [Higher Order Functions (HOFs)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-quick-intro-to-higher-order-functions-in-javascript-1a014f89c6b/)

## Requirements

To be considered complete:

- The JavaScript file and `npm test` must run without errors
- At least 10 out of 12 tests must pass

There are a series of prompts inside [`lib/challenge.js`](lib/challenge.js).
Work through all of the prompts. Each prompt is in the form of a JavaScript
comment. Write your code to solve the prompt after the comment.

Some prompts will require you to practice researching methods we did not learn
in class. Be sure to cite any sources that you used to help you write your code. This is part of the gradual release of responsibility as you grow into self-reliant devs and Googling experts! ðŸ§ 

**Remember to make a commit after each prompt and push your code up regularly.**

### Tests

1. From inside this directory, run `npm install` in your terminal. This will download the testing dependencies (mocha and chai).
1. Comment IN the module.exports at the bottom of the `challenge.js` file if you commented them out.
1. Run `npm test` in this directory. Read the output to checkout which tests your code is passing and failing.
1. If there are any errors, try fixing them and running the code again.
1. Keep module.exports commented-in when you submit your homework!
