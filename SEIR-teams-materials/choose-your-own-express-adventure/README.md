## Topics

### 1. [Express API Relationships](../../../express-api-relationships) üå∂Ô∏è
We've created many apps at this point that use a single or even multiple models but sometimes we'd like these models to have relationships. For example, we may want to create one-to-many relationship between an Artist and Songs since an artist will usually have multiple songs. This adventure is a no-brainer if you want to connect models to each other.

### 2. [Image uploads in ExpressJS](../../../express-s3-uploads) üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è
This guided tutorial will take you through the process end-to-end of getting started with AWS S3 to add images to your application. 

### 3. [Authentication & Authorization](../../../express-auth-api) üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è
This repo is a walkthrough on how to create a User model and add User authentication to your application. This lesson uses Passport.js and JSON Web Tokens to create sessions so any HTTP requests to perform CRUD operations will have to come accompanied by a token that will be verified by your backend. You'll learn how to store passwords securely as well as create a one-to-many relationship so your Users can connect to specific documents in other models.
