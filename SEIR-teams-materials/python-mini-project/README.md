# Python Mini Project

Get ready to build your first independent Django app! For this project, your goal is to build a
simple Django app with Django templates. 

## Prerequisites

- Python
- PostgreSQL
- Django

## Instructions

1.  Create new repo(s).
1.  Fulfill the listed requirements.
1.  Post an issue on this repository with links to your repo(s).

Unlike most labs, for this one you submit your work by **posting an issue on
this repository, instead of forking this repository and making a pull request**.

**_DO NOT FORK THIS REPOSITORY_**

Create a new repo. Complete the requirements below and post
an issue on this repository linking to the relevant repo under your GitHub
account.

## Requirements

Build a simple Django app! You need at least 1 model with full CRUD.

You can seed your app using the admin interface, or by writing a migration to do so.

Build a frontend that can access the API (React or Vanilla Javascript).    

If you're up for a bit of a challenge and want to work as a team:

You may do the mini project with the addition of file uploads to AWS S3. To get set up for this, you'll need to follow the instructions in this repo: https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-323/aws-s3-setup-guide

Alternatively, you may work as a team to build an authenticated Restful API with Django REST Framework and Simple JWT: https://github.com/davesque/django-rest-framework-simplejwt.  


## Bonus

- [ ] Add another model with full CRUD.
- [ ] Add automated testing
- [ ] Use a CSS framework
- [ ] Learn a Django library we didn't cover in class

## Double Bonus

Deploy your app. Use Heroku!
