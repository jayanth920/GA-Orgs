# React Password Validator

Recreate a password validator in React. Your final product should function
similarly to [this deployed version](https://password-validator-demo.herokuapp.com/) of the
component.

## Prerequisites

- React
- Components, state, and props

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository into your `sandbox` directory.
1. Change into the new directory with `cd password-validator`.
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
1. Open the project in VS Code with `code .`.
1. Back in the Terminal type `npm run start` to start your development server.
1. Complete the [requirements](requirements) listed below.
1. Create a pull request when done.

## Requirements

Take the existing markup rendered from the `Validator` component in
[`src/Validator.js`](src/Validator.js) and change into a fully functioning
component. 

## Steps

1. Add and initialize state for your form. Your state should include
   `username`, `password`, `passwordConfirm`, and `valid` properties.
1. Add a methods for handling each input's onChange event and set the value of each input to be what's currently stored in state.
1. Add a method to handle the form submission. Remember to **prevent the default** behavior of a form being submitted.
1. Display a message if the user's inputs are valid or invalid.

## Bonus

For the bonus:

- Add a class of `invalid` or `valid` to the message conditionally (CSS already exists).
- Add a cancel button that clears the fields when clicked. There is a cancel class you can add to the button to make it display red. (hint: make sure it has `type="button"`)
- Update the validation message any time the user types something in the confirmPassword input.
- Make sure passwords are at least 7 characters in length.
- Make sure passwords includes a number and a special character. (Check out
