## Topics

### 1. [Advanced React Labs](../../../react-bonus-labs-adv) 🌶️ 
This repository contains additional React labs that challenge devs to translate apps into React. If you would like more reps in building out React apps and practice with the State and Effect Hooks, this is the project for you. 

> Note that the CodePens contain jQuery! 

### 2. [Build a React Interface for an API with React Bootstrap](../../../react-bootstrap) 🌶️🌶️
This is a code-along exercise that will teach you how to use React Bootstrap, a Bootstrap package built specifically for React. Bootstrap is one of the most widely used CSS frameworks and a useful tool for any developer to build proficiency in. This tutorial also covers familiar topics such as React Router, React forms, API calls, the Component Lifecycle, and reusability of React components. Additionally, you'll see how to securely store an API key. Bonus: deploy! Another great option to prepare for project 2. 

### 3. [Learn the Reducer Hook and Custom Hooks while building an Ecomm store](../../../react-ecomm-tutorial) 🌶️🌶️🌶️

This is also a code-along exercise that will teach you how to create a simple e-storefront with a cart. You'll learn how to write a custom Hook, and also learn a little bit about a more advanced Hook for complex state management called Reducer. Bonus: deploy! A great option to push your understanding of React.

### 4. [Handle API error and loading states](../../../react-errors) 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️

This lab will teach you to how manage the loading, error, and success states for API calls using first State, then teach you how to use the Reducer hook to refactor multi-state logic more elegantly.

### 5. [Next.js](../../../nextJS) 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
NEXT.js is an open source React framework allows you to write server-rendered React apps super easily. Follow this tutorial to learn about server-side rendering and why it is great for building performant web applications! This adventure is for folks who feel comfortable with React and are ready to see what else React can do! 

### 6. [Redux](../../../react-redux) 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️

Redux is a state management solution for React. Rather than manage your state
inside your react components, you'll manage it all within Redux. If you have a
lot of state (i.e. your app is fairly large) or your state is complicated, Redux
provides strict guidelines and a simple interface that alleviates the pain of
managing state, if implemented correctly.
