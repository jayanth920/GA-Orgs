Title: Loop the Loop! Two Dimensional Sums<br>
Type: Coding Challenge <br>
Duration: "0:45"<br>
Creator: Karolin Rafalski<br>
Adapted for SEIR<br/>
Competencies:  Arrays, Loops, Breaking down a problem into smaller steps<br>
Prerequisites: JavaScript or Python Fundamentals<br>

Coding challenges are a chance for you to practice thinking through problems like a developer. It's okay to not finish all of them all of the time. If you get stuck, write some pseudo-code, talk to your teammates, and/or rubber-duck it out. Feel free to look up documentation and google for ideas, but not for whole lines of code. The purpose of these coding challenges is for YOU to practice breaking down the logic and algorithms in a way that makes sense to you. 

#### Instructions: 

It is up to you how and where you'd like to store your coding challenge work. One option is to use an online REPL (like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/nodejs)--sign up for an account so you can save your REPLs and progress), and the other is to work in a JavaScript file in your code editor. There are pros and cons to each option, but if you'd like to work in VS Code, you may follow the instructions below: 

1. Change directory into `./sei/sandbox` via terminal and clone this directory.
1. Change directory into `loopTheLoop` and use `code . ` to open in your code editor. 
1. Check output from JavaScript files using `node loopTheLoop.js` in the terminal from within this repo directory.

## Part 1: It's Hip to Be Square

**Make a function that that squares each number passed into it from an array, and sums the results.**

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 2] 

sumOfSquares(arr); //should return 9, because 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9.
```

## Part 2: Loop the Loop: 2D Array Addition

**Make a function that returns the greatest sum of a row, column or diagonal from a two dimensional array**


Make a function that takes one argument, a two dimensional array, where all the arrays are the same length, and returns the greatest sum of the numbers by row, column and diagonal.
```javascript
const arr = [ [10, 20, 30],
            [40, 50, 60],
            [70, -80, 90] ];

loopTheLoop(arr); //180
```

## Part 3: Bonus - Row, Column or Diagonal? 


Test your function on this data set and let me know if it was a row, column or diagonal that had the greatest sum!

```javascript
const bigArray =
[ [ 887, -541, -430, -590, 117, 172, -319, -18 ],
  [ -269, 964, 209, 840, -456, 156, 365, -568 ],
  [ 289, -41, 488, 198, 240, 124, -427, 214 ],
  [ 452, 894, 968, -149, 683, 977, 741, -805 ],
  [ 181, -714, -950, 107, 800, 751, -143, 380 ],
  [ 152, 493, 707, 914, 37, 356, -625, 608 ],
  [ -345, 906, 83, 676, 723, 381, 557, -183 ],
  [ 199, -943, -710, 565, 193, 315, 281, 245 ] ];
```

## Part 4: Super Bonus - Generate 2D Arrays 

Part A: Create a function that takes one argument, an integer, that makes a 2D array of random integers between 0  and 1000 where the length of the rows and columns is determined by the argument.

```javascript
function generateArray(integer) {
  //...your code here
}

generateArray(4); 
   // ...returns an array of arrays with random integers, with 4 rows and 4 columns: 
            [
              [ 888, 919, 267, 567 ],
              [ 717, 17, 121, 794 ],
              [ 170, 880, 816, 260 ],
              [ 844, 835, 608, 487 ]
            ]
```

Part B: Add a 30% chance that the integers in the array will be negative.

**Was this TOO EASY?**<br/>
- If you used nested loops in your code above, try refactoring to include array methods such as `.map()` and `.reduce()`.
- Sign up for [codewars](codewars.com) and choose a code challenge (in JavaScript) or three and solve them. Found a fun one? Share it in slack!
