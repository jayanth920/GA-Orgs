- [JS Events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaRrmOtPYTM)

## Requirements

A series of prompts are located in the `callbacks.js` and `bachelor.js` files.

- In `callbacks.js`, practice writing the logic in the callback functions to make each of the array methods work. üå∂Ô∏è
- In `bachelor.js`, practice choosing appropriate array methods and writing out the logic to find the required information. üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è

**Remember to make a commit after each prompt and push your code up regularly.**

### Optional:

**If you're curious about whether your code passes the tests written for this assignment, you can do the following:**

1. From inside this directory, run `npm install` in your terminal. This will download the testing dependencies (mocha and chai).
1. Comment IN the module.exports at the bottom of the `challenge.js` file if you commented them out.
1. Run `npm test` in this directory. Read the output to checkout which tests your code is passing and failing.
1. If there are any errors, try fixing them and running the code again.
1. Keep module.exports commented-in when you submit your homework!

## Tips

- Make sure you are committing your code after completing each question.
- Open the index.html file in Google Chrome to view your console.log() messages.
