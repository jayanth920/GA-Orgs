# Ember Dynamic Routing

## Prerequisites

-   [ga-wdi-boston.ember-routing-dynamic](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston.ember-routing-dynamic)

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Set up resource routes.
-   Create a Route object.
-   Configure a Route to parse information from a URL.

## Preparation

1.  [Fork and clone](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone)
    this repository.
1.  Install dependencies with `npm install` and `bower install`.
1.  Run the development server with `ember server`. Use the `--proxy` flag to
    avoid writing development-specific CORS and CSP settings.

## Code-Along: Routing to Resources

In the previous lesson on Ember routing, you learned how to generate templates
and connect to them via the Router.

Routes linking to (basically) static HTML are well and good, but most of the
time we're interested in showing and manipulating data from resources (e.g.
products). Although the routes for resources used to be distinct from normal
routes, in Ember 2 that distinction has disappeared - now, a route for a
resource (such as `products`) looks like any other route.

```javascript
// app/router.js

Router.map(function() {
  this.route('products');

  this.route('about');
  this.route('contact');
  this.route('team', function(){
    this.route('leadership');
    this.route('engineering');
    this.route('sales');
  });
});
```

However, in order for such a route to actually have data to load, we need to
create a Route object. As you may recall from the Ember Overview lesson, the
purposes of the Route object are (1) to parse the URL for a given route, and (2)
to use information from that URL to load model data.

Generating this Route object is fairly easy. In the case of a `products` route,
we can do this by running the command `ember g route products`; this will create
_two_ new files in the `app/products` directory, a Route file and a Template
file.

Let's take a closer look at that Route file.

```javascript
// app/products/route.js

import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({
});
```

The way in which a Route file makes data available to a Controller, View, or
Template is through a method that we define called `model` - this method returns
some data object that gets used within the route. In this case, let us suppose
that the `model` method returns an array of JavaScript objects, like so:

```javascript
// app/products/route.js

import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({
  model: function(){
    return [
      {
        id: 1,
        name: 'Crock Pot',
        manufacturer: 'Farberware',
        price: 40
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        name: 'Food Processor',
        manufacturer: 'Cuisinart',
        price: 25
      },
      {
        id: 3,
        name: 'Electric Griddle',
        manufacturer: 'George Foreman Grills',
        price: 15
      },
    ];
  }
});
```

If we wanted to access this data from a Template, we can do so by referencing a
property called `model` from within the Template, which points back to the
result of the model function from the Route. Let's make a change to the `products` Template so that it shows the names of the products listed above.

```html
<!-- app/products/template.hbs -->

<!-- {{outlet}} -->
<h2> Product Listings </h2>
<ul>
{{#each model as |product|}}
  <li>{{product.name}}</li>
{{/each}}
</ul>
```

`{{#each set as |item|}}` is a new construction for Ember 2. The pipes (`|`)
play the same role here that they do in Ruby.

## Lab: Routing to Resources

Create routes for each of the teams in our app: `leadership`, `engineering`, and
`sales`. Each route should have a model hook that loads an example collection of
employees on the team. Modify the appropriate templates to render the data from
each model.

## Routing with Dynamic Segments

Often, we don't just want to see the full list of a particular type of resource;
we want to be able to zoom in on one in particular. Although it deals with the
same type of resource, because it creates a different 'view state' than looking
at the list as a whole, _this must be represented with a separate route_. Let's
call this new route `product`, since it concerns zooming in on one product in
particular from the list.

```javascript
// app/router.js

Router.map(function() {
  this.route('products');
  this.route('product', {path: '/products/:product_id'})
  this.route('about');
  this.route('contact');
  this.route('team', function(){
    this.route('leadership');
    this.route('engineering');
    this.route('sales');
  });
});
```

The object passed in as the second argument to the `product` route contains the
actual path used to reach the `product` route. It's usually not necessary to
specify the actual `path`, since the URL and the name of the route are usually
the same; however, in this case, they are _not_ the same, so we _must_ specify
the `path` explicitly.

The `:product_id` section of the `path` is called a dynamic segment; much like
you've seen in Rails and Express, this part of the URL is a placeholder for a
value, typically a number. The name `:product_id` is not special, and in fact we
could have chosen any name for that segment.

As mentioned earlier, one of the two big responsibilities of the Route is to
parse the URL and extract meaningful information - dynamic segments are the
primary instance of this. Let's create a new Route for `product` (`ember g route
product`).

```javascript
// app/products/route.js

import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({
});
```

We still need a model for our Template; however, this time, rather than
returning all products, we want to only return one, based on the value passed in
as `:product_id`. As it turns out, though we usually ignore it, the `model`
function normally accepts an object as an argument (typically called `params`)
which holds data from that route's dynamic segment; if we extract that property
from `params` (`:product_id` is stored at `params.product_id`), we can use it to
look up the data we want.

```javascript
// app/product/route.js

import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({
  model: function(params){
    return [
      {
        id: 1,
        name: 'Crock Pot',
        manufacturer: 'Farberware',
        price: 40
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        name: 'Food Processor',
        manufacturer: 'Cuisinart',
        price: 25
      },
      {
        id: 3,
        name: 'Electric Griddle',
        manufacturer: 'George Foreman Grills',
        price: 15
      },
    ][params.product_id - 1];
  }
});
```

Since our Route has a `model` method, we can now access the data from that
method in the Route's corresponding Template.

```html
<!-- app/product/template.hbs -->

<!-- {{outlet}} -->

<h2> Product Details </h2>
<h4>{{model.name}}</h4>
<h5>${{model.price}}</h5>
<p>Manufactured by <em>{{model.manufacturer}}</em></p>
{{#link-to 'products'}}Back to Product Listings{{/link-to}}
```

Now if we navigate to `http://localhost:4200/products/3`, we can now see
information about the third product on our page.

Since this now works, let's make one final change: replacing the hard-coded HTML
in the `products` template with `{{#link-to}}` helpers pointing to the specific
pages for each product.

```html
<!-- app/products/template.hbs -->

<!-- {{outlet}} -->

<h2> Product Listings </h2>
<ul>
  {{#each model as |product|}}
    <li>{{#link-to 'product' product}} {{product.name}} {{/link-to}}</li>
  {{/each}}
</ul>
```

## Lab: Routing with Dynamic Segments

Let's make employee profiles. Create routes for showing individuals on each
team. Those routes should pass employee IDs to the model hooks. You will also
need a new template.

## Bonus: Refactoring

Move model hook code into a service so that you can re-use it in different
routes.

After that's done, the next challenge should be a bit simpler: create an
employees route that shows all employees regardless of team, and change the
team routes to filter all employees using a dynamic segment.
