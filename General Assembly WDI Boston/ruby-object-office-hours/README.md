## :orange: Build an Orange Tree

Make an OrangeTree class. 
It should have a height method which returns its height, and a oneYearPasses method, which, when called, ages the tree one year. 
Each year the tree grows taller (however much you think an orange tree should grow in a year), and after some number of years (again, your call) the tree should die. 
For the first few years, it should not produce fruit, but after a while it should, and I guess that older trees produce more each year than younger trees... whatever you think makes most sense. 
And, of course, you should be able to countTheOranges (which returns the number of oranges on the tree), and pickAnOrange (which reduces the @orangeCount by one and returns a string telling you how delicious the orange was, or else it just tells you that there are no more oranges to pick this year). 
Make sure that any oranges you don't pick one year fall off before the next year.

## :dragon_face: Build a Baby Dragon Pet  

Let's say we want to make a simple virtual pet, a baby dragon. Like most babies, it should be able to eat, sleep, and poop, which means we will need to be able to feed it, put it to bed, and take it on walks. Internally, our dragon will need to keep track of if it is hungry, tired, or needs to go, but we won't be able to see that when we interact with our dragon, just like you can't ask a human baby, "Are you hungry?". When he is born we'll give him a name.  You should be able to enter commands like feed and walk, and have those methods be called on your dragon.

## :space_invader: Build a Space Game 

Aliens have invaded a space ship and our hero has to go through a maze of rooms defeating them so he can escape into an escape pod to the planet below. 
The game will be more like a Zork or Adventure type game with text outputs and funny ways to die. 
The game will involve an engine that runs a map full of rooms or scenes. 
Each room will print its own description when the player enters it and then tell the engine what room to run next out of the map.
