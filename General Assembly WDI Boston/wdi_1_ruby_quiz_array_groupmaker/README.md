Ruby Arrays: Groupmaker Pop Quiz
===================

Your boss rushes into your office with a frantic look on their face. You know this can only mean one thing; they have a problem and they are going to give you an impossibly short deadline. 

"I've got an array of people that sometimes I need to mix up into groups. I just need to have it ask me for how large of a group, and then it creates random groups. If anyone is left over, just throw them into the last group. But I think you can do this easily, so can you get this done in say... the next 7 minutes for me?"

There are no RSpec/Travis tests setup for this quiz. Put your code in the included `groupmaker.rb` file which already has an array of people.
