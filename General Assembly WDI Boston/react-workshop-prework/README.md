# React Workshop Preparation Work

You will need to complete the setup, reading, and excercises outlined in this
document before you arrive at GA for the week-long React crash course. This
should take 10-15 hours, but may take a bit less if your development
environment is already set up and your Javascript game is strong.

## Overview

- [Environment Setup](setup.md): All the tools and configuration you'll
need to develop React apps
- [Modern JS Reading](modern-js.md): Get up to speed on the latest features
of the Javascript language
- [Debugging Excercise](fix-me.md): Troubleshoot and fix a simple front-end webapp
- [Refactoring Excercise](modernize-me.md): Refactor the same app to use modern
Javascript syntax and best practices

## Deliverables

You should fork this repository on Github and clone it down to your computer.
After you've completed the setup guide and the JS reading, start working on the
two coding excercises. You are expected to commit your progress as you go, with
small, logical commits and good explanatory commit messages. Don't do the two
excercises at once! Fix this app first, then refactor it to use modern JS.

When you have completed both excercises, open a pull request from your fork to
the original repository. We'll look at this pull request to assess your work
on these excercises.

## Questsions, comments, concerns

If you need clarification on any of the requirements or are having technical
trouble please reach out to us the Slack channel you've been invited to. We'll
be happy to help!
