## Assessment

All quizzes will have at least five questions. Some may have additional. Your *primary score* will be assessed from the first five questions, and your *bonus score* will be assessed from any additional questions. You should attempt to answer the first five questions first, as they will be easier and have few/no tricks. Additional questions are checking for more in-depth understanding, but are optional and you may not get to them. Feel free to skip around in the first five questions to complete them in any order.
