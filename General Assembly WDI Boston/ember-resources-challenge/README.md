You may wish to refer to ["How do I submit diagnostics?"](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/Diagnostics)
and other [FAQs](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/) related to
[forking, cloning](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone),

some of the most common sources of errors.
