# Ruby vs. JavaScript: Objects Study

There's no distinction between objects and key-value pairs (a.k.a. associative
arrays, a.k.a. dictionaries, a.k.a. hashes) in JavaScript. In fact, JavaScript
objects look and behave similarly to Ruby hashes. However, Ruby hashes behave
differently from JavaScript objects.

## Prerequisites

- General Assembly Boston: JavaScript Series
  - [JavaScript Reference Types](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/js-reference-types)
  - [JavaScript Objects: Modeling](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/js-objects-modeling)
  - [JavaScript Objects: Referencing Own Properties](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/js-objects-this)
  - [JavaScript Constructors](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/js-objects-constructors)
  - [JavaScript Prototypes](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/js-objects-prototypes)
- General Assembly Boston: Ruby Series
  - [Ruby](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/ruby)
  - [Ruby Array](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/ruby-array)
  - [Ruby (Hash) vs. JavaScript (Dictionary)](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/ruby-vs-js-hash-dictionary-study)

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

- Compare and Contrast Ruby objects and JavaScript objects.
- Define a class for an object in Ruby that assigns attributes in the
    constructor.
- Create an instance of an object in Ruby using the `new` method.
- Write setter and getter instance methods for Ruby objects and JavaScript
    objects.
