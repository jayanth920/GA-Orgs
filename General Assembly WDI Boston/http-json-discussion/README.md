# HTTP & JSON Discussion

What is JSON? What is HTTP? Let's have a class discussion to figure it out.

## Prerequisites

- [HTTP Study](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/http-study)
- [JSON Study](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/json-study)

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

- Define "World Wide Web (WWW)" and "Internet", then contrast the two.
- Define "protocol" and recall which protocol the WWW uses.
- Define "JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)".

## Preparation

1. Fork this repository (you do not need to clone).

## The World Wide Web

If I were to say to you, "the web is a set of services", how would you respond?
What does that mean to you?

Let's define a few terms:

- **server**: A server is *software* that processes HTTP **requests**
    and builds **responses** to be sent back to a **client**.
- **client**: A client is *software* that makes HTTP **requests** and
    processes a **server**'s **response**.
- **request**: A message sent to a **server** which requests a document.
- **response**: A message sent to a **client** which contains a document.
- **protocol**: A rule or set of rules defining proper communication.

How is the web different than the Internet?

The Internet is a telecommunications network. All telecommunications
networks—from telegraphs, through phone and radio, and to teletype—facilitate
transmission of data from one point to another.

The World Wide Web (WWW, or simply "web") is a distributed, world-wide
collection of documents transmitted over the HTTP protocol.

## Review: HTTP

Take some time in your teams to discuss what you learned about HTTP
previously. Refer to
[`http-study`](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/http-study/blob/master/study.md)
and answer the following questions:

1. What is HTTP?
1. What are the steps in the HTTP request/response cycle?
1. What are the five components of a URL?
1. What are four common HTTP verbs?

## Discuss: HTTP

Let's share some things we learned about HTTP. What are some questions you
have?

## Review: JSON

Take some time in your teams to discuss what you learned about JSON
previously. Refer to [`json-study`](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/json-study/blob/master/study.md)
and answer the following questions:

1. What is JSON?
1. What is JSON not?
1. What does JSON not support, and what will happen if you try something
    JSON does not support?
1. Is JSON data or code?

## Discuss: JSON

Compare your solution to
[`json-study@solution`](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/json-study/blob/solution/study.md).

Let's share some things we learned about JSON. What are some questions you
have?

## Discuss: The Web

What happens when a typical document loads?

After discussing these steps together, we'll draw a diagram of the HTTP
request/response cycle.
