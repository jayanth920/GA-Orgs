# Rails API: Clinic API (Code-along)

This is part of the Rails API sequence of talks. Each talk has its own
repository with a reference README.

-   [Rails API: Single Resource](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-single-resource)
-   [Rails API: One-to-Many](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-one-to-many)
-   [Rails API: Many-to-Many](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-many-to-many)

Each talk is designed to walk through the creation of a real Rails API,
feature-by-feature, using "error driven development". Developers should have
completed the introductory [Rails
API](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api) talk. This sequence ends with
[Rails API: Behavior-Driven
Development](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-bdd), where
error-driven-development is replaced by automated testing.

Each talk covers three domains, and therefore, three APIs. The demonstration
API, developed by consultants, is followed by a code-along API, in which
developers and consultants work together to build the API. Finally, developers
are expected to build their own API as part of the laboratory portions of each
talk.

-   [Library API](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-library-demo)
-   [Clinic API](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-clinic-code-along)
-   [Cookbook API](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-cookbook-lab)

These API repositories contain a few important branches:

-   `master` contains starter code.
-   `solution` contains a feature-complete reference API. History is not
    canonical.
-   `tutorial` contains detailed commit history, and tags for where each talk
    should end.

## Preparation

1.  Fork and clone this repository.
1.  Create a new branch, `training`, for your work.
1.  Checkout to the `training` branch.
1.  Install dependencies with `bundle install`.
1.  Create a `.env` for sensitive settings (`touch .env`).
1.  Generate new `development` and `test` secrets (`bin/rake secret`).
1.  Store them in `.env` with keys `SECRET_KEY_BASE_<DEVELOPMENT|TEST>`
    respectively.
1.  Setup your database with `bin/rake [db:drop] db:create db:migrate db:seed
    db:examples`.
1.  Run the API server with `bin/rails server`.

## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

-   `bin/rake routes` lists the endpoints available in your API.
-   `bin/rake test` runs automated tests.
-   `bin/rails console` opens a REPL that pre-loads the API.
-   `bin/rails db` opens your database client and loads the correct database.
-   `bin/rails server` starts the API.
-   `scripts/*.sh` run various `curl` commands to test the API. See below.

<!-- TODO -   `rake nag` checks your code style. -->
<!-- TODO -   `rake lint` checks your code for syntax errors. -->
