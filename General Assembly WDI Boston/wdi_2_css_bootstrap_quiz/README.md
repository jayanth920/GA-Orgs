## Question 1:

`index.html` has a series of boxes. Please add a bootstrap grid to corral these boxes. When the display has a width larger than 992px, have 3 boxes per row. When the screen is less than 992px wide, have two boxes per row

## Question 2:

SURPRISE JQUERY AND 'THIS' QUESTION! In `app.jss`, add a click handler that allows a user to remove a box when they click it.

## Question 3:

`bio.html` is part of our app, but users currently have no way to navigate to it. Add a header that allows users to navigate between it and the homepage. Do not leave any dead links.

## Question 4:

Add a grid to the biography page. Make it so that all the text on the page is in a column that is 10 col wide and centered no matter what size the display is.
