# Homework: SQL the Hard Way

Read the Introduction and complete exercises 1 through 13 of the [Learn SQL the Hard Way](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/) book. Don't worry, it's actually not that hard. =) These exercises use SQLite, a simpler database package than PostgreSQL that stores each database as a single file. **You already have SQLite installed** on your Macs &ndash; type `sqlite3` in a terminal and you should see a SQLite command prompt (type `.quit` to exit).

Fork this repository and use it to store any `.sql` and `.db` files you create. Make a commit after completing each exercise. Since the base exercises just involve copying commands from the book, **attempt to complete all of the extra credit** and place any statements you write in the `.sql` file for that exercise. These should be very doable from what we've already learned in class. When finished, submit a pull request.
