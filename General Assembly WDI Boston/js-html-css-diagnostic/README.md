# JavaScript, HTML, and CSS Diagnostic

You have one hour

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Change into the new directory.
3. Install any dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Create and checkout a new branch, named `response`.
5. Follow the directions given in [`exercise.md`](exercise.md).
6. When finished, push to your fork and submit a pull request.

Your pull request description should contain a "fist to five" for comfort and
clarity. Additionally, you should mention the resources you used to help you
complete this diagnostic. For example:

```md
Comfort: 3
Clarity: 3

I used Google and my class notes to help with this exercise.
```

You may wish to refer to [FAQs](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/)
related to [forking,
cloning](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone), and [pull
requests](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/PullRequest).

You may use **any resource** other than each other to complete this exercise.
This includes referencing talk materials, appropriate documentation, and
searching for help online.

You should be running `grunt nag` before diagnosing any bugs, since it finds
some of the most common sources of errors. After `grunt nag` passes, you should
run `grunt test` to run the included tests. Tests will tell you whether of not
your responses are correct.

It's probably a good idea to include the above verbatim in each exercise.
Remember to edit the link to the actual exercise file (it might be stored in a
different directory or have a different extension). If tooling is not included
in this exercise, feel free to remove that bit from these instructions.
