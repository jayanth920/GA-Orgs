 Now might be a good time to use the built-in Node debugger:
 https://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html

 Built into Node, the debugger can help as you inspect and write code.

 Put `debugger` (without the quotes) in your code,
 and then run the file with the `inspect` command: `node inspect <filename>`
 continue with `cont`, enter repl with `repl`, exit repl with `ctrl-c`
