# Javascript Simple Events Lab

## Create a javascript application that will:
Have a button that will change the state of the application each time it's clicked.
For example, create an app that will cycle through a set of images that will be shown below the button for each button click.

* Use DOM Level 2 Events.
* Write most of the javascript in a file in the src directory.
* Namespace the javascript.
* All of the states of the app should be kept in a javascript array of arrays.
  * Each array will represent an application state.
  * The first element in the array will be the name of button in this state.
  * The second element in the array will be the path to the image for this state.

### Extra
Show some other indicator, not an image, of a state.
