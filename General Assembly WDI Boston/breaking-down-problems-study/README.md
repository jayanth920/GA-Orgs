# Breaking Down a Problem

So you wanna build a game! Or an app! Or solve an algorithm! Nice.

BUT WAIT -- where to start?

As developers we not only need to know the syntax of a certain language or the
methods of a framework/library, but we also need to understand how to take a
problem and break it down into steps that can be performed by our code.

## Prerequisites

- None.

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

- Break down a problem into "codable" steps
- Identify potential modules of a certain application
