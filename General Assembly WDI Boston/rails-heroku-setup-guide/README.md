# Rails Heroku Deployment

You've learned a lot about how to build a Rails application over the last few
weeks. Now let's "go public" and share our apps with the world!

## Prerequisites

- [rails-api](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api)
- This guide assumes you have followed [these installation instructions](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-template#installation)
up to where the steps mention Heroku.

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers will be able to:

- Explain what Heroku is
- Create a Heroku app from the command line
- Deploy their app to Heroku
- Configure their production application environment
- Setup their production database
- View their running application

## Heroku
