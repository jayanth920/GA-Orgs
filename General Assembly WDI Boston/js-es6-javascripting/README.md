Navigate the menu with the up & down arrow keys.

### Take a look at this gif that shows the first challenge:

![first challenge](javascripting.gif)

In the gif I'm using the command line editor `nano` ([here are some basic usage tips for nano](https://github.com/sethvincent/dev-envs-book/blob/master/chapters/05-editors.md#nano)).

You can use any editor you like.

[atom](http://atom.io) or [brackets](http://brackets.io/) are both good options.
