# JavaScript Predicate Challenge

"Predicate" is a term used to refer to methods that return boolean values (
`true` or `false`). You'll define several predicate methods, but the challenge
will be defining a helper function that takes as arguments a collection of
arrays and a collection of predicate methods and combines them.

## Prerequisites

-   [ga-wdi-boston/js-array-methods](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/js-array-methods)
-   [ga-wdi-boston/js-array-methods-diagnostic](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/js-array-methods-diagnostic)

## Instructions

1.  Fork and clone this repository.
1.  Change into the new directory.
1.  Install dependencies.
1.  Create and checkout a new branch to work on.
1.  Fulfill the listed requirements.

Starter code is available in [`lib/challenge.js`](lib/challenge.js). A pull
request is note required, but it is necessary if you want a code review.

You may wish to refer to [FAQs](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/)
related to [forking,
cloning](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone).

## Requirements

-   Create the predicate functions described in
    [`lib/challenge.js`](lib/challenge.js): `.isEven()`, `.isDivisbleBy()`, and
    `.isLongerThan()`.
-   Create the helper function that will combine a collection of predicates
    with a collection of arrays and return a results object as defined in
    [`lib/challenge.js`](lib/challenge.js).

You should be running `grunt nag` before diagnosing any bugs, since it finds
some of the most common sources of errors. After `grunt nag` passes, you should
run `grunt test` to run the included tests. Tests will tell you whether of not
you've met these requirements.
