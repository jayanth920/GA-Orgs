# Step 1
# Create a ticket.rb file!!
# We've been using instance methods, mostly
# object.message.
# The ticket should have a venue, price and date
# The venue and date cannot be changed

# Step 1.1
# Create an instance of a ticket.

# How may methods are we calling here?

# Ticket.new is a class method because it's the job 
# of the Ticket to create new ticket instances

# Step 1.2
# Look up Class.new method
# http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Class.html

# Step 2 
# Create a class method to find the most expensive ticket given a set of
# tickets.

# finding the most expensive ticket wouldn't make sense
# if it was a method that was called on a Ticket object.

# Only makes sense in the realm of all the Tickets
# which is represented by the Ticket class.

# Step 3
# Show other ways of defining a class method.

# Step 3.1 
# Using the name of the class to define a class method

# Step 3.2 
# Using some ruby magic. It's only magic right now.

# Step 4 
# We can create a class that is ONLY has class methods.
# Create a Temperature class that only has two class methods
# one to covert f to c other to convert c to f.

# Step 5
# What are some build-in Ruby classes that don't have
# instance methods?

# Step 5 
# Class methods vs instance methods.

# 1) Instances created by classes are object.
# 2) Classes are objects too.
# 3) A class object (like Ticket) has it's methods, it own state
# and it's own identity.
