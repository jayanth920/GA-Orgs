# Python Study

You've already learned the basics of programming with JavaScript, and you've
begun to think like a problem-solver. You've had practice reading JS code and
predicting execution by evaluating expressions in your mind.

We'll continue to reinforce the basics of programming, but this time with
Python. This may seem like a lot of material to cover in a short time, but the
truth is our task is simpler than it was when we introduced JS. Instead of
teaching you how to program, we'll focus on the differences between Python and
JS with the goal of utilizing the foundation we've already built.

"Polyglot" is a term used to refer to someone who can use two or more
languages. By learning two languages, we increase your understanding of basic
programming concepts, as well as give you an edge in the job market.

You will reference this material again and again over the next few weeks. Focus
on noting the differences between Python and JS. The [HyperPolyglot](https://hyperpolyglot.org/scripting)
reference is an amazing resource you can use to keep track of the differences
between Python and JS as you're learning.

## Prerequisites

- Utilize different primitive types, control structures, and methods in Python
- Use the python interactive shell

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Create and checkout to a new branch, `response`, for your work.
2. Follow the directions given in [`study.md`](study.md).
1. When finished, push to your fork and submit a pull request.

You may use **any resource** other than each other to complete this exercise.
This includes referencing talk materials, appropriate documentation, and
searching for help online.

Your pull request description should contain a "fist to five" for comfort and
