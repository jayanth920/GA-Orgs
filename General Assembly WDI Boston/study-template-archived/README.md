# Study Template

Use this template to structure your READMEs for studies. Remove text from this
section, or use it to frame the study. Good framing answers the question "Why am
I learning this?".

Be sure to include a recent [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) and Markdown linter
configuration ([`.remarkrc`](.remarkrc)). Also, include an appropriate
`.gitignore`; these are usually found in specific technology templates, for
example [js-template](https://www.github.com/ga-wdi-boston/js-template).

## Prerequisites

-   Topics with which developers should be familiar with.
-   Prerequisites are "just-in-time", so if I have a prerequisite that mentions
    Sass, I would **not** need to include CSS as a prerequisite.
-   [Links to previous materials](https://www.github.com/ga-wdi-boston/example)
    are often useful. Previous materials might include talks or other studies.

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Write objectives that focus on demonstrating knowledge.
-   Write learning objectives that begin with an [imperative
    verb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood).
-   Avoid objectives that start with "Use" or "Understand".
-   Rewrite objectives that begin with "Use" by inverting sentence structure.
-   End each objective with a period.
