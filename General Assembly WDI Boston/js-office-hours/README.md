 [FAQ](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone)
1. Create a new branch, `training`, for your work.
1. Checkout to the `training` branch.
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
1. Open the repository in Atom with `atom .`.

*Note*: Create and switch to a new branch at the same time with the shortcut:
`git checkout -b <new branch name>`.

## Introduction

We will be practicing the basics of JavaScript.

## JavaScript (Day 1)
The practice problems in [bin/js](bin/js) came from a really neat site called Code Wars. The problem descriptions are provided below.

When you're writing your answer in `/bin` **don't worry about creating a single function!** These We can just work on the problem in the js file.

Test your code with node! We can run the first problem with `node bin/js/1-traffic.js`

### Practice Problems
#### Level 8 (Beginner challenges)
1. [Kata Stats: Thinkful - Logic Drills: Traffic light | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/58649884a1659ed6cb000072) if statements
2. [Kata Stats: Grasshopper - Summation | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55d24f55d7dd296eb9000030) (loops, summing numbers)
3. [Kata Stats: If you can't sleep, just count sheep!! | Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b077ebdaf15be5c7f000077) (loops, building a big string)
4. [Multiplication table](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a2fd38b55519ed98f0000ce) (loops, numbers)
5. [Can divide by](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a2b703dc5e2845c0900005a) (numbers)
6. [Sum all `n` multiples below `m`](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57241e0f440cd279b5000829) (sum, loops)

## JavaScript Reference Types (Day 2)
The practice problems in [bin/reference](bin/reference) will allow you to practice
with reference types! Practice solving problems using objects, functions, and arrays!
