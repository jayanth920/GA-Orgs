// Given an amount of dollars and cents, find the fewest number of coins that
// will add up to that amount. Represent your answer as a JS object, like this:

// 2.35 -> { quarters: 9, dimes: 1, nickels: 0, pennies: 0 }
// 0.99 -> { quarters: 3, dimes: 2, nickels: 0, pennies: 4 }
// 1.43 -> { quarters: 5, dimes: 1, nickels: 1, pennies: 3 }

const amount = 1.71

// your code here!

// BONUS: write a function that takes `amount` as a parameter and returns the
// objects described above
