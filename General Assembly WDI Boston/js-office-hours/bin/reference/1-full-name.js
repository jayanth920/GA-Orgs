// Given an object containing a first and a last name, produce a string of the
// names seperated by a space. Your code should be able to work for any set of
// first and last names, so don't just write the full name by hand.

const name = { first: 'Bob', last: 'Ross' }

// desired output: 'Bob Ross'

// your code here!

// use `console.log` to check your work
