Ruby Cheatsheets! 
======================

Fork and clone this repo. Create a new file for your cheatsheet and say who wrote it - e.g. `arrays_by_david_anna.rb`

Your cheatsheet should demonstrate all the important things about a particular topic. Comment every line to explicitly say what it's doing - especially the tricky parts. Try to give the higher-level perspective too - what's the point of using an array vs. a hash? What is each datatype useful for? 

Sample cheatsheet (as a starting point): https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/wdi_1_ruby_demo_array_manipulation/blob/master/array_colors_demo.rb

When you're done with your cheatsheet, submit a pull request. I will accept your pull request and we will have a class collection of cheatsheets!
