#### Question 1
# Replace the comment below with a single line of code that will set the
# robot's online status to `true` and correctly output the debugging string.

class Robot
  def online=(value)
    debug_output("online status: #{value}")
    @online = value
  end
  
  def activate
    # Replace me!
  end
end


#### Question 2
# Given the following class, write code that would create a single robot and
# deactivate it. Then write code that would deactivate all robots. Do not change
# the class definition -- assume the methods do what they say.

class Robot
  def deactivate
    # ...
  end

  def self.deactivate_all
    # ...
  end
end


#### Question 3
# Write a module called `Speech` and add an instance method called `say` to it
# (no code needed in this method). Then add code to the Human and Robot classes
# that will allow them to use the `say` method.

class Human
  def chat
    say('How about that weather?')
  end
end

class Robot
  def chat
    say('Small talk program not installed.')
  end
end


#### Question 4
# Replace the comment below with code that will raise a Robot::ImmobileError
# when `move` is called on a robot that has no legs and no wheels.

class Robot
  class ImmobileError < StandardError; end

  def initialize(legs: 0, wheels: 0)
    @legs, @wheels = legs, wheels
  end

  def move(target)
    # Replace me!
  end
end


#### Question 5
# Modify the `qualified?` method below so that it returns `true` if the robot
# passed into it can move and `false` otherwise. Assume the `move` method will
# raise a Robot::ImmobileError if the robot cannot move.

class RobotRace
  def qualified?(robot)
    # Modify me!
    robot.move
  end
end


#### Bonus Question
# Copy and paste the classes from questions 4 and 5 here, then modify them so
# the qualification check can be done without having to rescue an error. In the
# real world this approach is preferred, if we have control over both classes.
