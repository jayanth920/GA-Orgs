# Ember Components Diagnostic

Record your responses inside the fenced code blocks below each question.

1. Give an example of a visual hierarchy that could be modeled with components.
   Explain why each piece might be it's own component.

    ```md
    <!-- your response here -->
    ```

1. What is the command to generate a new component called '`my-map`'?

    ```sh
    # your response here
    ```

1. What files are created and/or edited to produce a component, and what are
   their responsibilities?

    ```md
    <!-- your response here -->
    ```

1. Suppose you have a component '`my-contact`', which is loaded from
   '`app/templates/components/contacts.hbs`' when visiting the `/contacts` route.
   What is the syntax (code that is written) to render this component inside that
   template?

    ```html
    <!-- your response here -->
    ```

1. Each contact has multiple phone numbers. Suppose you also have '`my-phone`'
   nested under '`my-contact`'. What is the code you would write in
   '`app/templates/components/my-contact.hbs`' to load the nested component and
   pass it data?

    ```html
    <!-- your response here -->
    ```
