# Site Cloning Mini Project

Using Ruby on Rails, clone the basic functionality (login, creating and interacting with content, etc) of one of the following websites:

* Reddit
* Hacker News
* Imgur
* Bit.ly
* Quora / Stack Overflow

It is very possible that we haven't covered some skills required to create these in class (photo upload for Imgur), but its up you to be resourceful and figure them out! Use Stack Overflow, Hack Hands, each other, our books, Google and the instructors as needed. 

This is due on Friday. Make sure to make dozens (or hundreds) of Git commits. Deploy frequently to Heroku. 

This mini project will give you the experience needed to tackle your big project starting Friday!
