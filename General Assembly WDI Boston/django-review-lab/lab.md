# Django Review Lab

You should have spent some time going through the [`django-study`](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/django-study).

In your teams, use that study material to help you answer the following questions. All questions should be able to be answered using only that material.

## Environment Check

> Note: If you already ran these as a part of the study, feel free to

**From within the `django-env` folder**, run the following commands:

```sh
pipenv shell
pipenv install
pipenv install django==3.0
```

Afterwards, each person's `django-env` folder should contain a `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`. We'll talk more about these files in class.
