## Prerequisites
- [js-functions-ins-and-outs](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/js-functions-ins-and-outs)

## Objectives
By the end of this lesson, developers should be able to:

- Identify why one would use closures
- Create and invoke closures
- Explain the difference between javascript function declarations and function expressions
- Compare and contrast variable and function hoisting
- Identify why one would use recurssion
- Create and invoke a function that uses recursion
- Explain what a design pattern is

- Identify and implement the singleton pattern

## Preparation
1. [Fork and Clone](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone) this repository
1. Create a new branch, `training`, for your work
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`

## Introduction
JavaScript has many advanced patterns and features that we do not have the time to dive into. Until today! While we won't cover all of javascript's advanced features, we will take a look at some of the more common patterns and features, some of the most useful, and some of the most commonly misunderstood.

## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

-   `grunt nag`: runs code quality analysis tools on your code
    and complains.
-   `grunt test`: runs any automated tests; may depend on `grunt build`.
-   `grunt`: runs both `nag` and then `test`
-   `grunt make-standard`: reformats all your code in the standard style.
