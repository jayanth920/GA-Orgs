# React Office Hours

## Prerequisites

- react
- react-router
- react-styling

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

- Practice using state and props in React components
- Practice using React Router to set up front-end routes
- Practice styling React components

## Preparation

1.  Fork and clone this repository.
 [FAQ](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone)
1.  Create a new branch, `training`, for your work.
1.  Checkout to the `training` branch.
1.  Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## React Basics: Components, Props, and State

### Refresher

- What are components?
- What are props?
- What is state?

### Code-Along

Let's make some simple components for a counter application.

We'll make a component class `Counter` and a functional component `CounterButton`, which will be used inside of `Counter`.

## React Routing

### Refresher

- What is `react-router`? Is it built-in to React?
- What component do we use to define our front-end routes?
- What component can we use to allow users to navigate around the app?
- What do we mean by "nested routes"? How do we accomplish this?

### Code-Along

Let's add a few more components to our application, `Home`, `About`, and `Nav`.

Then, we will add some routes to allow our user to navigate to the `Home` page, `About` page, and `Counter` page.

## React Styling

### Refresher

What are some ways we can style applications? What are the differences of each?

### Code-Along

Let's style some components! We will make it up as we go along, working together.
