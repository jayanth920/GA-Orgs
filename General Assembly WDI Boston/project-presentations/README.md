# Project Presentations

We ask you to present your projects because we believe it is important for you
to not only know how to talk about your work, but to be able to talk about your
experience working on a project with a potential employer. Your presentation in
front of your colleagues should help you prepare a short list of talking points
you can share at the Meet & Hire event, as well as in interviews.

Presentations are not evaluated as part of your completion of the program, but
if you do not present you will not complete the program. The bottom line: don't
sweat! You're among people who wish for your success. The only requirement is
that you stand up and share your experience with us.

## Presentation Format

You will have five minutes to talk and two minutes to take questions. Questions
will be asked via Slack, and the moderator will deliver them to you when you are
done speaking.

If you receive questions you were not able to answer during your allotted time,
it's a great idea to follow-up in Slack!

## Presenter Expectations

Your goal is to tell a story. We want to know what it was like to work on this
project: what were your takeaways from this experience, and how did you grow?

You are expected to demo a **deployed** application.

## Audience Expectations

If you would like to ask a question or give encouragement, you should do so in
the projects channel on Slack. Questions from consultants and other staff
*might* take precedence in the queue, at the discretion of the moderator.

## Talk Structure

If you'd like a recommended structure for your talk, we've found the following
works well:

1.  Give us the elevator pitch. Why did you pursue this project? What does it
    do?
1.  Demo one or two features from your application.
1.  Answer some of the following example questions:

    -   If you had another week, what would you work on next?
    -   What will you do differently for your next project?
    -   What is the most valuable thing you learned?
    -   What did you struggle with? How did you overcome?
    -   How does your confidence compare to a week ago? Three weeks ago?
    -   What are you most proud of? Is there any code you want to show off?
    -   Why should I hire you?
    -   Were you able to help others?
    -   How did you find help when you needed it?
    -   When did things start to "click"?
    -   Describe your development process from start to completion.
    -   What did you have the most fun doing with your project?
    -   What was the inspiration for your project?
    -   What is different about programming than you expected coming into the program?
    -   Has your feelings towards planning changed at all? (wireframes, user stories, erd)
    -   Has your appreciation for complex websites increased at all after this process?
    -   What did you learn about yourself during this project?
    -   If you could go back to day 1 of the project and give yourself one piece of advice what would it be?
