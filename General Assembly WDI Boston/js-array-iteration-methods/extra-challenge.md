# Challenge Labs: Dive deeper and build your own array iteration methods

These labs are designed to be challenging! If you're feeling less comfortable
with array iteration methods try
1. cloning down a fresh copy of the repo and going through the exercises again
     on your own
2. try the additional practice in [extra-practice.md](extra-practice.md)

## Lab: Adding functionality - count

`Array.prototype.length` tells us the number of elements in the array.  But what
if we want to know the number of elements that pass a certain test?

We'll build a function that counts the elements in an array for which a
predicate callback returns `true`.

## Lab: modeling `forEach`

Write your own `myForEach` method that accomplishes
what `forEach` does.  HINT:  use `for` loop

## Lab: modeling `map`

Write your own `myMap` method that accomplishes
what `map` does.  HINT:  use `forEach` method

## Lab: modeling `filter`

Write your own `myFilter` method that accomplishes
what `filter` does.  HINT:  use `forEach` method

## Lab: modeling `find`

Write your own `myFind` method that accomplishes
what `find` does.  HINT:  use `findIndex` method

## Lab: modeling `some`

Write your own `mySome` method that accomplishes
what `some` does.  HINT:  use `findIndex` method

## Lab: modeling `every`

Write your own `myEvery` method that accomplishes
what `every` does.
