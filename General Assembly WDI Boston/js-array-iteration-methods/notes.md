## Delivery Notes

### Framing
- Introduce the talk, framing how this will be difficult. The developer does not need to understand the inner workings right now. They simply need to know how to use the tool. How to use the drill to screw in a nail, not the inner workings of the drill.

### Callbacks
 - Call various developers to repeat what a callback is, until it's an automatic response.

### Arrow Functions
  - Give example of arrow function with implicit return.
  - Make sure to mention that implicit returns only occur with single expression function bodies.
  - Two ways to use: with `{}`, which in regard to return works same as other js functions. And without `{}`, which leads to implicit return.
  - Reinforce that a javascript function normally returns undefined unless you specify `return ...`
  - Use arrow syntax for callbacks and function expressions for everything else.

### Two steps for building callbacks (taught in 2 steps, so we can test the callback in isolation)

### Practice Problems

If the lesson ends early here are some suggestions:
1. Ask developers to clone down a fresh repo and try the problems from class on
     their own
2. There are extra problems in `extra-practice.md`, though you might need to
     show developers how to use code wars or tell them to write their answers in
     new JavaScript files
3. If the developer is super far ahead, show them `extra-challenge.md` where
     they can remake the array iteration methods. This has historically been
     very difficult. We might need better explanations/tests if we want it to
     be more accessible.
