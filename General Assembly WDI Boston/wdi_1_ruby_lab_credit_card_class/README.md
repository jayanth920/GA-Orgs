# Lab: Credit Card Class w/RSpec

Use RSpec and TDD (write test first, then code. Small pieces at a time) to write tests and a class to describe a `CreditCard`.

The `CreditCard` class should have the following attributes:

- Credit card # (16-digits)
- Expiration Date (two digit month, two digit year)
- CCV (3 digit number on the back)
- Name
- Billing Zip Code (5-digits)

It should have the following methods:

- `initialize` - Used for creating a new credit card.
- `valid?` - This checks the validity of the credit card. Check that it has a name, proper length zip code, 16-digit number and an expiration date in the future.

Do *not* check a real credit card number into version control.

- Use a Luhn algorthm to determine if the credit card number is potentially valid
- Write a `card_type` method that will return Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express or Other
