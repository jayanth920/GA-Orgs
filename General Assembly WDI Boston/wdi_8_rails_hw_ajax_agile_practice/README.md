# Agile Development with Ruby on Rails AJAX Practice

## Assignment

This week, we've learned jQuery and AJAX. Last Friday, you were tasked with reading Chapter 11 in the Agile Web Development with Rails 4 book. Now that you've learned and practiced more, your task is to code along with the book, using this code as the basis of your work. Do a pull request so I can see your work.

Take special care and attention to the logical flow of requests and diagrams in the book.

Tomorrow we'll be covering Rails + Ajax + jQuery together, and you'll be expected to have a solid foundation for us being able to move through this material with confidence and speed.

## Credit

This exercise was created by Pragmatic Programmers/Sam Ruby as part of the [Agile Web Development with Rails 4](http://pragprog.com/book/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails-4) book. General Assembly takes no credit or ownership of it, and is simply using it for educational purposes in our WDI program.
