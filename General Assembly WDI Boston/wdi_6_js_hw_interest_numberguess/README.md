# JavaScript Day 1 Homework

This assignment consists of two distinct tasks:

1. Write a [simple interest calculator](http://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-Simple-Interest) for loans. Ask the user for the amount borrowed, interest rate, and number of years, and output the amount of interest that will be paid.

2. Write a JavaScript version of the [Guess the Number](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/wdi_1_ruby_hw_number_guess) game from Week 1. As before, the user should get three chances to guess a randomly-generated number between 1 and 10, getting a high/low hint if they guess incorrectly.

Having a mastery of these will help greatly in this class. This includes patterns that are undesirable, but which you may find yourself doing. It also further highlights best practices and pitfalls to avoid.
