# Ruby vs. JavaScript: List Challenge

List processing is a very common task in applied computer science. Ruby and
JavaScript both have good list processing facilities, but they differ quite a
bit. This challenge requires you to solve the same two problems in both Ruby and
JavaScript.

These problems require passing functions as parameters. You should have
experience with this in Javascript (callbacks) but in order to do this in
Ruby you should read up on [this article](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/using-blocks-in-ruby).

## Prerequisites

- [JavaScript Array Methods](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/js-array-iteration-methods)
- [Ruby Array Methods](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/ruby-array-methods)

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.
1. Install dependencies with `bundle install` and `npm install`.
1. Create and checkout a new branch to work on.
1. Fulfill the listed requirements.

Starter code is available in [`lib/challenge.js`](lib/challenge.js),
[`lib/challenge.rb`](lib/challenge.rb). A pull request is not required, but it
is necessary if you want a code review.

You may wish to refer to [FAQs](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/)
related to [forking,
cloning](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone).

## Requirements
