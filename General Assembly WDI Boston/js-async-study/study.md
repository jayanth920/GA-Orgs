# JavaScript Async Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

These studies focus on the differences between Asynchronous Code, and
Synchronous Code. For the most part, you can think of the differences as the
following. However, the readings will go into much more detail on the
differences and patterns of each.

Synchronous Code - operations that occur sequentially: ask db for data; wait; db
gives data; do something with data.

Asynchronous - operations that may start in a certain sequence and may end in
any permutation of that sequence while unrelated stuff happens in between.
