# HTML/CSS Homework

Design and implement a basic site using HTML/CSS and images. Make 6-8 interlinked pages using the HTML/CSS that we learned today. Be as serious, creative, or funny as you'd like to be.

Make sure you use at least one of each of the following:

* `h1` and other headings
* `p`
* `ul` or `ol`
* `dl`
* `a`
* `img`
* `div`
* `span`
* `section` or `article`
* `nav`
* Tag, ID, and class selectors in CSS

Use the W3C [HTML Validator](http://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS Validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to ensure your code has no errors and few warnings. 

You may include a CSS reset, but all other CSS must be your own &ndash; no frameworks.

## Bonus

Try using the [Schema.org](http://schema.org) microformat to add additional meaning to the page. 

Try using [Google Fonts](http://google.com/fonts) to make the page all spiffy.
