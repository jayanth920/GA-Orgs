#### Question 1
# Define an empty class called `Pet`, and an empty class `Dog` that inherits from `Pet`.
# These classes should not contain anything yet.

#### Question 2
# Add an initializer to the `Pet` class that accepts two arguments
# the first called called name and stores the value as an instance variable,
# the second called sound, which has a default value of 'woof'
# and stores the value as an instance variable

#### Question 3
# Copy your class definitions from question 2 here.
# Then add an instance method called `bark` to the `Dog` class that returns the
# value of the sound instance variable.

#### Question 4
# Write a method call make_three_dogs that takes 3 strings as arguments
# The method should create 3 instances of Dog, with those arguments as their names,
# and then return an array containing the 3 instances of these dogs.

#### Question 5
# Write a method called all_dogs_bark, which takes an array of Dogs as an argument
# The method should return an array of elements, which are strings
# of the dog's name, the string ' says ' and the sounds they make when they bark
# For example:
# all_dogs_bark([Dog.new('Lucy')]) #=> ['Lucy says woof']
# all_dogs_bark([Dog.new('Lassie'), Dog.new('Kelly', 'growl')]) #=> ['Lucy says woof', 'Kelly says growl']
