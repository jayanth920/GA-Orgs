# Sinatra Lab 1: Twitter & Stock

Your boss has just told you that they want a simple way of keeping an eye on what's happening with a stock, both financially, and on Twitter. Your task is to make this happen. 

## Instructions

Use Sinatra, the Twitter gem, HTML/erb, CSS and a finance gem to create a page that allows you to put a stock symbol in the URL (like `http://localhost:4567/stocks/GOOG`) and then shows you a page of recent tweets, and some of the current relevent stock information (price, 52-week high/low, volume, etc) on a page. 

You don't need to prompt the user for which stock. Just assume your boss knows the URL to go to.
