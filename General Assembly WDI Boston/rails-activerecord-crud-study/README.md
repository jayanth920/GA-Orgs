# Rails: ActiveRecord Study

ActiveRecord is a Ruby library that serves as an object-relational mapping (ORM)
tool. ORMs allow us to use a language other than SQL to perform CRUD operations
on our data. ActiveRecord translates Ruby code into SQL and also creates Ruby
objects from database rows.

ActiveRecord is a part of Rails and is used in the model layer. It allows us to
use Ruby to manipulate objects without worrying about how those objects are
persisted.

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

- Explain the value of an ORM in developing an application.
- Name model files and classes according to Rails's naming conventions.
- Reference basic CRUD operations in ActiveRecord using the Rails
    documentation.
