# MBTA Trip Calculator, Take 2!

The purpose of this application is to use Sinatra to rebuild our MBTA Trip Calculator for use on the web!

You should use a select dropdown form to determine the begining and end points for the trip. This should submit a `POST` to the server, which will then display the number of stops that the trip will take.
