#Title: jQuery TicTacToe Lab

### Assignment

Work in pairs to create a Tic Tac Toe game with jQuery.

Tic Tac Toe is a game where 2 players alternate turns and try to get 3 boxes in a row (either a row, column, or diagonal). Provide a message on the screen when a player wins, with a button to start a new game. Also, make sure to check for stalemates.

Before you start, consider how you will best track the state of the game.

The CSS and HTML has already been provided and needs minimal (if any) modification.

### To do:
* Get the cells to change color when you click on them
* Get the cell color to alternate on turn
* Add logic to check if a player has gotten 3 in a row for a row
* Do the same for columns and diagonals

### Bonus:
* Are there ways to refactor your code to make it DRYer?
* Can you have it so that a player plays against a computer rather than another player?
* Can you make the computer unbeatable?
