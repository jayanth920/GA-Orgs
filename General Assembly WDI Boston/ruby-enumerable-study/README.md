# Ruby Enumerable Study

## Objectives

By the end of this study, developers should be able to:

- Compare Ruby Array and Enumerable methods.
- Explain why `length` is not a sensible property of an enumerable.
- Compare enumerable to stream.

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.
1. Create and checkout a new branch, named `response`.
1. Follow the directions given in [`study.md`](study.md).
1. When finished, push to your fork and submit a pull request.

Your pull request description should contain a "fist to five" for comfort and
clarity. Additionally, you should mention the resources you used to help you
complete this diagnostic. For example:

```md
Comfort: 3
Clarity: 3

I used Google and my class notes to help with this exercise.
