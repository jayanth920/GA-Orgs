In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

- [Enumerable definition at google](https://www.google.com/#q=enumerable+definition)
  - The google definition of enumerable
- [Ruby Array Class](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.0/Array.html)
  - The _description_ of the Ruby Array Class (the part before [Creating Arrays](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.0/Array.html#class-Array-label-Creating+Arrays))
- [Ruby Enumerable Module](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.0/Enumerable.html)
  - The _description_ of the Ruby Enumerable Module (the part before
    **Public Instance Methods**)
- [List ADT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_%28abstract_data_type%29)
  - The _overview_ of the List ADT at Wikipedia (the part before the Contents block)
- The list of method names in the **Methods** block on the left side of
  [Ruby Array Class](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.0/Array.html) and
  [Ruby Enumerable Module](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.0/Enumerable.html).
  - Note that Enumerable is listed as an **Included Module** for Array.

## Methods on Array and Enumerable

List at least two instance method names (other than `count`) that Array and
Enumerable share. An included module provides behavior to instances of the
including class. Why might Array redefine methods included from Enumerable?
Please give reasons for the methods you list.

## Array#length versus Enumerable#count

Although both Array and Enumerable have a `count` method, Array also defines the
method `length`.  Why is `length` sensibly defined on Array but not Enumerable?

## Compare Enumerable to Stream

Please read the Wikipedia entry for
[Stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_%28computing%29).  How are streams
like enumerables?  How are they different?  Please compare and contrast these
types.
