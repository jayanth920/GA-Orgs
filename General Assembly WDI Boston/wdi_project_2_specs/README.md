# Project 2 Specs - WDI Q1 2015

Students will work in assigned groups of 3-4 to complete a project exercising skills in JavaScript, Ajax, Ruby on Rails, Postgres, external APIs and Heroku.

Each project prompt will be done by two groups, so there is someone else in the room surely working on the same problem you are.

**While there are significant technical problems in this project, the most difficult thing about this project is working with a team for a week.**

## Shared Requirements

All groups regardless of project have some shared requirements documented below.

#### Technology

You will use Ruby on Rails and JavaScript for the core functionality. You may use 3rd party gems and libraries as-needed, but beware on becoming overly dependent on libraries to solve basic problems. You may use additional external services such as CodeShip, CodeClimate, TravisCI, etc to improve your workflow and end-product.

For your static assets, it is highly recommended that you use [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) to help scaffold out grunt tasks, structure and workflow.

You will deploy to Github Pages and Heroku. Depending on your project, you may find that additional services such as Amazon S3 and Cloudfront are required for full functionality and best practices.

#### Planning

You *must* take time to plan, organize and do some initial designs upfront. Working in a team is hard and cannot happen in a haphazard manner. The first day of project work should be dedicated to such planning.

#### Project Management/Issue Tracking

Each group will use a *digital* project management or issue tracking software. It is suggested that students evaluate and consider using [Asana](https://asana.com), but others including [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/), [Wrike](https://www.wrike.com/), [Github Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/), [Trello](https://trello.com/) or [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org/). Do not spend too much time worrying about which one to use as none of them are perfect.

You *must* add all members of the instructional team (including Matt Brendzel) to your management software so that we can see your progress.

#### UI and Design

While this is *not* a design class, it is expected that you put in reasonable efforts to make the site visually pleasing and have a clean workflow. You may use Bootstrap or similar CSS framework to give you a better toolset for getting started.

#### Deployment

Your project *must* be deployed to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (for static assets; HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc) and [Heroku](https://heroku.com) for your Rails API.

#### Testing

Your app should be *heavily* tested using RSpec and Jasmine (as appropriate). Your Ruby code should have [test coverage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage) in excess of 85% when evaluated with a tool such as [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/). Your JavaScript code should also have strong test coverage.

#### Fair Distribution of Work

Students should participate fairly in their groups, and it is not acceptable for 80% of the code to be written by one person. [Pair programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) is encouraged, as is [code review](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review), team problem solving and equitable distribution of work.

You must maintain frequent (near constant) contact with your group members; no one should *ever* wonder what you're working on. Falling out of touch with your team or the instructional team is grounds for failing to graduate from the WDI program.

#### Git Usage

You will use a Git branching model similar to what we [practiced in class](https://gist.github.com/tibbon/659ec05ef178ba2e77e0). Do not make commits directly to the master branch when at all possible. Merge in pull requests frequently. Push code to Github frequently so that instructors can view your progress.

#### Presentation

You will present your project for ~10 minutes, showing functionality, interesting challenges and code and talking through decision making and workflow. Everyone is expected to participate in the presentation. Practicing the presentation prior to giving it is recommended. No Powerpoint slides.

#### Gotchas and Difficult things

Each project has one or two hard sections that we anticipate, and we note these in the project specs. Depending on the difficulty and obscurity of the problem, we may have provided some 'helper' code or hints to assist. If you are provided with any helper code, make sure you trace through it fully and understand what is happening.

### Tip: API Documentation & Faking

You can use something like [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to both fake an API *temporarily* and also to start documenting the JSON that your API should return. Using a tool like this, it should be possible to start building the *majority* of your site (file upload and stripe API are harder, but not impossible, to fake) without having all of the back-end done.
