# Pixelect: Image Sharing

## Outline
Deciding the best photo is hard, but other people can help you choose the best image in a set that you upload. Put together a platform that lets users upload sets of images (more than one) with a question ('Which is the cutest cat?') and let other users vote to determine the top photo. Users should also be able to have a conversation in comments about the photo sets.

## Assets (provided to students)
- name ("Pixelect")

## Must-Have Features
- Users (anonymous or logged in) must be able to upload sets of images and write a question/prompt that others will use as their voting criteria. (e.g. 'Which photo has the best composition?', 'Which photo of me is funniest?')
- Front page must show the most actively voted upon image sets from the last 24 hours and also recent uploads.
- Users must be able to log in; users who are not logged in can upload images, but cannot comment or vote.
- Users must have usernames, but a full profile is not necessary.
- Logged-in users must also be able to comment on, and upvote/downvote on other peoples’ image sets.
- Logged-in users must also be able to comment on other users’ comments.
- Images are uploaded to S3 and served from Amazon Cloudfront

## Nice-to-Have Features
- Track and display the view count for each image set.
- Photo sets can be uploaded via drag/drop to the site.
- Users can tag image sets with a category and browse sets by tag.
- Logged-in users are able to flag offensive image sets for moderation, and after 3 flags they are automatically hidden from the public.
- Users have the option to get notifications sent to them (with context; i.e. “User X replied to your comment, ‘Blah blah blah’ ”)
- Users can crop and apply filters to their photos

## Gotchas

Image upload must persist to Amazon S3/Cloudfront, and handling the upload process with JavaScript is tricky. We have included some code for Rails that can help out greatly with this. Don't just blindly use the code however, and make sure that you use `pry` to trace through it completely, and potentially even refactor it.
