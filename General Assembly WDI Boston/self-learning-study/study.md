# Self Learning Study

Read this document and the required readings. Then, respond to all questions
within the code blocks.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Why Self Learning

![Remember, a few hours of trial and error will save you several minutes of looking at the README](https://media.git.generalassemb.ly/user/16103/files/8ca9fa80-e41b-11e8-96c2-f0f3ae3ad6db)

A developer's learning journey is never finished. No matter what tools you may
know, there are always more to come and more to learn. Being able to effectively
teach yourself new skills and solve problems that arise as you do so will be
invaluable not only to you, but to any employer or client with whom you work.

It is *highly unlikely* that you will arrive at your first job with 100% of the
experience and knowledge required to complete the job. It's *highly likely* that
even the lead developer will spend much of their time researching questions and
documentation in order to solve problems. This is not uncommon, and comes with
the job.

## Required Readings

- [Importance of Learning to Google Efficiently for a Programmer](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/65918/importance-of-learning-to-google-efficiently-for-a-programmer)
  - *Look for the _checked_ answer*
- [Hasty Treat: Reading Documentation](https://syntax.fm/show/073/hasty-treat-reading-documentation)
- [20 Tips for More Efficient Google Searches](https://www.dumblittleman.com/20-tips-for-more-efficient-google/)

## Research Formula

Consider the following research formula: _Subject + Verb + Programming Language_

This could be used to write a search like "Add an item to an Array in Javascript",
that has a Subject (Arrays), a Verb to describe what we want to do with them,
and the programming language with which we are working.

Re-write this HTML/jQuery search using that formula:
`"I need to show something on my webpage"`

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
```

## Slimming Down Search Results

Let's say you're trying to search for "insert into ruby array" online. How could
you write your search so that you only are shown results from
[the ruby docs](https://ruby-doc.org)?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
```

## Diving into Docs

Let's say you had to start learning [Meteor](https://docs.meteor.com/) today for
a new job tomorrow. Where would you start? Where would you head next?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
```

## Params syntax

No two docs are the same, but often they use similar syntax for declaring
required and optional params for API methods so that developers aren't left
guessing.

Based on the following declaration of the jQuery `.on` method, categorize the
parameters here as either required or optional:

```js
.on( events [, selector ] [, data ], handler )
```

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
```

## These Docs SUCK!

Sometimes documentation isn't super helpful. Describe what you might do if you're
trying to learn something, but the documentation is getting you nowhere fast.

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
```

## StackOverflow

StackOverflow is one of the largest sources of community-compiled development
questions-and-answers. What are some ways you can utilize StackOverflow to find
*the best* answers to your questions?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
```

## The Point of All This

What is the point of researching a problem, method, language, or technology?
What should we achieve by the end of our research?

*Hint: It's not "to find the solution"*
