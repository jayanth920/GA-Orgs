Using the included schema and sample data (you can add more if it helps your testing), write SQL queries that will answer the questions listed in `queries.sql`. These are listed roughly in increasing order of difficulty, with the last two being extremely tricky. Do not expect to complete them all! Limit yourself to about 3 hours on this.

If you think you have a query correct and want to check your answer, `results.txt` contains the expected results for all of the queries when run on the provided sample data.
