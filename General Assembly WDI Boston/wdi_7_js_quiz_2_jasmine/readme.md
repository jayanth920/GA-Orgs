# JavaScript Jasmine Quiz



Please see `src/Quiz.js` and `spec/QuizSpec.js`.

The first tests for the first question are already written.
COOL!

Write the corresponding code. You may reference your *Ruby* solutions and things online, but you may **not** reference your JavaScript quiz from yesterday. 

To run your tests open `SpecRunner.html`.

For the remaining questions write __both__ the tests and functions.
AGAIN?!
