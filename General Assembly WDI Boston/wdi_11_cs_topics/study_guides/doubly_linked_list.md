    What is it?:
         - Each node knows what node is in front and back of it.
          
          - Allows for forward and backward traversal.
          
          -Allows for a traversal to begin at either head or tail node.
          
          - Slower than a singly-Linked list.

                         
    When would you use it?: ex. If you want to sort cars in a list linearly by year you can check if the year 
                                youâ€™d like to insert is closer to the tail or the head and decide whether it  
                                would be more efficient that would be more efficient to start your traversal 
                                to begin your traversal from the head or tail node cutting back on traversal time.


    How different is it from singly linked lists?: You can start your search from either head or tail node and 
                                                    traverse in either direction. Whereas, in a singly linked list
                                                    a search traversal must begin at the head and restart whenever 
                                                    backtracking is necessary.
