# Mini Project

The purpose of this is to use `PHP` and `laravel` to create a new
project.

Take your time and have fun learning a new and useful language/framework. This
exercise will help grow your coding ability. Over the last 10 weeks you have
learned 3 languages and various frameworks and libraries. Certain patterns and
problem solving skills are common across all of them.

Throughout your development career you will need to be consistently learning.
Recognizing patterns and learning how to learn are some of the core concepts we
have tried to impart during the course.  Please apply these skills to this
project.
