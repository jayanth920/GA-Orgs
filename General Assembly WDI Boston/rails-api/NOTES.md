- structure for the MVC lab. This can be adjusted for the amount of developers in
  the cohort. This incorporates the V layer as its own role in the serializer
  which I think is useful because serializers are often a point of confusion for
  project 2.
  - serializer: shouldn't say that it only filters data out, because it can also
    define an attribute that doesn't exist in the database.

# MVC Lab

**NOTE:** If the class is too small to have multiple groups, the excercise
should be performed with just one group. No developer should have multiple roles
(e.g. model and controller) because that's too confusing.

Per each cohort:

## Prep

- Replace the entire contents of each tab with the contents of the
  corresponding "Master" [tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AwvOerq7gZ9rd6LfC8is8vNGU8-ShSbe-jlHLLKyJ5c/edit#gid=1271885362)

## In Session

- Tell developers there are tabs for the different groups on the spreadsheet
  - give each group a number
- Give name tags for each controller/model
- Bring 3 x 5 cards that developers can use to pass the requests / JSON around
