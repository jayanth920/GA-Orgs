# JavaScript: `javascripting` Study

**This study should be completed over multiple evenings.**

[NodeSchool](https://nodeschool.io) is an excellent free and open-source
resource for learning Node.js. We will use NodeSchool in the future to help us
learn to learn how to develop APIs using Node.js. For now, we'll use the
[javascripting](https://github.com/sethvincent/javascripting) workshop to review
what we've learned so far.

## Prerequisites

-   [WDI Fundamentals](http://fundamentals.generalassemb.ly)

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Recognize common, fundamental development patterns in JavaScript.
-   Work with primitives, reference types, control flow, callbacks, and array
    methods.

## Instructions

1.  Fork and clone this repository.
1.  Change into the new directory.
1.  Create and checkout a new branch, named `response`.
1.  Follow the directions given in [`study.md`](study.md).
1.  When finished, push to your fork and submit a pull request.

You may wish to refer to [FAQs](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/)
related to [forking,
cloning](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone), and [pull
requests](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/PullRequest).

## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

-   `grunt nag`: runs code quality analysis tools on your code
    and complains.
-   `grunt test`: runs any automated tests; may depend on `grunt build`.
-   `grunt`: runs both `nag` and then `test`
-   `grunt make-standard`: reformats all your code in the standard style.
