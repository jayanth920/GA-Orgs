# JavaScript: `javascripting` Study

1.  Install `javascripting` by running `npm install --global javascripting` from
    the command line interface.
1.  Run `javascripting` from the command line interface and follow the
    instructions
1.  Commit early and often as you work.
1.  Add your work to the `lib` directory.

## Working Instructions

-   Work in `strict` mode to allow use of `let` and `const` (`javascripting`'s
    instructions will instruct you to use `var`).
-   Use commit messages as your learning journal by making notes of challenges
    and what you have learned after completing each exercise. Try to write
    your commit messages with a subject line that is less than or equal to 50
    characters, a blank line, and then a body that is wrapped at 72 characters
    per line. ([example](https://github.com/jrhorn424/learnyounode/commit/5db673a16d4af82d3c5a80240edeb93b0e4dbd0c)).
-   Push the changes to GitHub so that future employers can get an idea of what
    your learning process (not to mention your tenacity!) is like.

## Optional Response

If you wish, then you may open an issue and include any questions that you still
have about JavaScript or any other topic that you want to explore further in a
one-on-one meeting. If you do this, then be sure to schedule your one-on-one
meeting with a consultant and link to your response issue, which will serve as
an agenda for the meeting.
