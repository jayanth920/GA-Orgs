# Interview Take Home Practice

A repository of real world interview take home tests that developers face.  

Instructors can search the [issues](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/interview-take-home-practice/issues) for various challenges.  

Each issue is [labeled](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/interview-take-home-practice/labels) by what that exercise could be used as practice for:

- html/css
- responsive
- javascript
- ajax and 3rd party apis
- js 3rd party libraries
- react
- back end api

Instructors should repurpose each design and exercise as needed.  As an example, by adjusting the prompt, the same exercise could be used for a unit 1 student to practice html/css and a unit 3 student to practice ajax and 3rd party api calls.
