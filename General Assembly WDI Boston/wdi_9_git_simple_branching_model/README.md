# Simple Branching Model for Group Work

This repo is a demonstration of a simple git branching model that will make working in groups easier.

A few definitions:

- commit: A set of changes made to files.
- branch: A parallel context for doing work and making commits.
- merge: Combines two or more sets of changes.
- feature branch: A branch where you work on a *singular* feature or issue.
- development branch: A branch where you merge your features. May have potential for failing code/tests.
- master branch: A branch that is ready for server deployment.
- staging branch: A branch where you can test code that you may want to deploy to servers, but needs testing.
