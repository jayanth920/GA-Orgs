## Easy: A Simple Counter

Your user wants to count!

This app should have two buttons: one for increasing the count and one for resetting
the count to 0. It should also display the count for the user.

Here's an example of what this app might look like.

## Medium: Star Rating System

This application will display star ratings (out of 10) depending on the user's
chosen rating.

This app should have ten buttons, one for each potential rating (1 through 10).
When a user selects a rating by clicking a button, the number they select should
be represented with golden star images. The remaining stars (10 total) should
be just star outlines, no color.

For example, if a user selected a 4 out of 10 star rating, they should see the following.

## Hard: Calculator

This application should be a simple calculator.

This app should have:
- Buttons 0 through 9 for each number of the calculator
- Buttons for addition `+`, subtraction `-`, multiplication `*`, and division `/`
- Button to calculate user input and display total
- A display of each button user presses, ex `3 + 6 * `
- A way to clear calculations
- A display for any errors during calculations
