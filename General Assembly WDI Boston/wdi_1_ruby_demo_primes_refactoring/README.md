Refactoring Demo
================

In this demo, I show 4 different ways of writing a Ruby method to check if a number is prime. 

Remember the coding principles: 
- Single Responsibility Principle (a method should do one thing, and one thing only)
- Don't Repeat Yourself (if you find yourself typing the same code twice, it's probably a good idea to refactor)
- Separate Input, Output, and Computation
