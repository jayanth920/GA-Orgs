Before you get started, please read this exerpt from the first section of [a
blog post](http://pragmatic-backbone.com/routing-and-controllers) on
    Backbone's Router:

>"For the vast majority of cases, we want users to navigate through the app, and
for the user to be able to go back to the screen they were using the browser
history (back/forward buttons). These screens are in reality states of the
app: *new book form visible*, *viewing a list of books I own*, *browsing a
book*, and so on, are examples of possible states that the UI is in.
>
>As to what screen changes warrant a state, it depends on how granular you want
the user experience to be. For instance, you may decide to show the new book
form in place, perhaps right above my list of books, and not have a dedicated
URL (or a page) for creating new books. Or maybe there’s a large volume of
information to be filled in it and you’d like to avoid cluttering the screen, so
it makes more sense for that form to live in a screen of its own.
>
>The point is that while common sense (and known patterns) will provide great
guidelines when it comes to deciding that, without taking UX into
consideration, there are no absolutes. Backbone, like Ember or Angular, will
give you a tool for creating screen states with URLs. Choosing what's
appropriate is up to you and what you're building.
>
>Hence if and where you choose to have state in your app, you’ll need to use the
router for constructing the UI. The low-level logic for doing all that won't
live in the router itself of course. Instead, it'll fetch data using
models/collections, and it’ll instance and render views to display the data.
Put simply: it's with the router that you'll 'assemble' your application where
state applies."
