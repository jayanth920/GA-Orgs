to help you learn and implement CSS Flexbox.

Once you are done, use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to
research and respond to the following questions. The [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)
website is a great playground to test your code.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your

## Flexbox: Align right

Suppose you have two paragraph tags stacked vertically on top of one another
wrapped in a parent div with the class `wrapper`. Write the code to align the
`p` tags side-by-side on the right side of the page. (See example HTML below)

```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <p>First paragraph</p>
  <p>Second paragraph</p>
</div>
```

```scss
<!-- your answer here -->
```

## Flexbox: Vertical & horizontal align

Assuming you only have one paragraph in your `.wrapper` div, how would you
center your paragraph in the middle of the page? Assume your `.wrapper` div has
a set height of 300px. (Your paragraph should be both vertically and
horizontally centered.)

```scss
<!-- your answer here -->
```

## Flexbox: Columns & alignment

Suppose you have three spans displaying one next to another within your
`.wrapper` div. Use Flexbox to stack them in reverse order at the bottom right
corner of the div. Assume your `.wrapper` div has a set height of 300px. (See
example below)
