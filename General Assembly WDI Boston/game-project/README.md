# The Game

In our first project, let's start out with something fun - **a game**!
Specifically, We'll be making **Tic Tac Toe**, a game that takes seconds to
learn but minutes to master!

## Required Reading

- [Requirements](requirements.md)
- [Suggested Schedule](schedule.md)
- [Game Project API Documentation](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/game-project-api)
- [Project Issue Tracker Guide](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/project-issue-tracker-guide)
- [Feedback](feedback.md)

### Optional Reading

- [Stretch Goals](stretch_goals.md)
- [Tips](tips.md)

## Objectives

By the time you submit this project, developers will have covered new ground in
many of the big themes of the course:

- **Command Line**: Interacting with the computer and navigating the
  filesystem from the command line.
- **Source Control**: Managing and interacting with a git repository to store
  changes to code.
- **Programming Fundamentals**: Working with objects, constructors, and
  events, while learning how to strategically solve problems and resolve
  errors.
- **Web Fundamentals**:  Structuring, styling, and animating documents within
  a browser; responding to actions your users take and the data they input
  into the browser.
- **Browser Applications**: Using AJAX to connect to a back-end application.
- **Server Applications**:  Read documentation about how API
  endpoints work, and how to get data from them.
- **Deployment**: Host a static web site in a managed hosting environment
  (GitHub Pages)
- **Documentation**: Document your code and your code repository so
  others understand what you've built.

## Project Week

Project week is **four days of independent work time**, and includes attendance
at 9am and announcements at 4:50pm as usual. If you need to miss any of
the regular course hours, you must let the instructional team know and find
time to make up that work missed.

As this is an independent project, you will be responsible for doing your own
work and reaching out for help when you need it. Collaborating with your peers
is encouraged, but **you** must write and be able to explain all of your code.

### Getting Help

The [Game-Project Issues](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/game-project/issues/new) is where you will be able to reach out on this project to get help.
The required [`project-issue-tracker-guide`](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/project-issue-tracker-guide) reading goes into more
details into using the issue tracker and how it will train you for a real
development job.

**We do not offer 1:1s on request for coding help.**

> Please note that an issue template has been added to this repository.
> This means that when you open an issue here, the textbox will autofill with
> a helpful template outlining important information to add to your issue.
> Not only will adhering to this format bring a smile to all of our faces but
> it *will* bring clarity to your issue (for you and us!) and get it resolved
> *faster.*

## Goals

At a high level, here are our goals for you in this project:

- **Build your own web application** that is hosted live on the web
- **Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files** in your application
- Build an application **to a spec that someone else gives you**
- Use your programming skills to **solve the game logic for a game**
- **Code an interactive game** that allows a user to play tic tac toe against themself
- **Communicate with a back-end** (which we'll provide for you) to store the
  state of your game.
- **Craft a `README.md` file that explains your app** to the world

You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you
along the process and helping as you go. Everyone will get a chance to **be
creative**, and work through some really **tough programming challenges** to get
your feet wet in the world of web development.

### Stretch Goals

This is a very challenging project, and the goals we set up for you will be
plenty of work in the four days. With that said, the only way to grow is to
push ourselves to reach higher and higher! We'll provide some [stretch goals](stretch_goals.md) as
additional suggestions to make your project stand out on your portfolio. Any
and all stretch goals are considered "polish" on top of the MVP goals.

> **_Important: Make sure you reach all MVP requirements before even considering
> any stretch goals._**

## Environments

While working on this project you will have to manage a few different coding
"environments". This is extremely common in web development, and for this project
you'll be managing some new environments as part of the requirements.

### The Codebase

You've already worked with two different "codebases" during this program every
time you've cloned, pushed, or pulled code to and from Github.

While you are developing your application, you'll have a **local** folder of
files where you are working on your code. You'll then _add, commit, and push_
that code up to the **remote** location on github throughout your development
to track your changes and work.

### The Application

You'll also be working with separate **development** and **production**
environments now that you'll be _deploying_ your application to the world.

While on the development environment, you'll be editing code in Atom and
working with a locally running server (using the command `grunt serve`) at
`http://localhost:7165`, and communicating with the development API and database.

Once you deploy your application to GitHub Pages, it will be available at it's
production URL, something like `https://username.github.io/repo-name` depending
on your username and what you name your repository. While users interact with
that deployed application, they will be interacting with the production API and
database. _This means if you sign up on your development `localhost` and then
go to the production `github.io` application, that user may not exist. You'll
have to recreate it._
