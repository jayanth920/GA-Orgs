*Note: This will be sent to students by your course producer. Producers, click [here](../../resources/syllabus/adi-prework.key) to find a template that describe the onboarding task that you can update and send to students.*

In order to ensure your students' success in the course, weâ€™ve created a student on-boarding task that will take most students between 10-15 hours to complete.

Students should create this task before their first day so that both students and their computer will be prepared for class.

## Pre-Course Checklist

Students should complete the steps described below relating to:

1. [Accounts](#account)
2. [Install](#install)
3. [Practice](#practice)
4. [Resources](#resources)

### 1. Accounts

- [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join), if you don't already have one.

<a name="install"></a>
### 2. Installation

For this class you'll need to install and set up the following tools/software:

- Java Development Kit
- Android Studio

Please follow the installation instructions below. If your installation is not complete or if you have any problems, plan to arrive at least 30 minutes early to the first class so that our TAs can help you get set up!

- **Java Development Kit**: Before anything else, you need to install Java on your system. This can be a little tricky and requires a little bit of coding; don't panic and make sure to follow these steps closely:

    - Go to <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>
    - Download Java Platform JDK (see image below)
    - Select the `Mac OS X x64` option under the Java SE Development Kit box
    - Make sure to accept terms & agreements
    - Open the `.dmg` file and follow installation steps
    - Verify that Java has installed successfully by opening the `Terminal` app on your Mac (you can search for Terminal using Spotlight search on your Mac)
    - Once Terminal has loaded:

    ![java-check](http://cl.ly/image/1m0I0x011P2U/Screen%20Shot%202015-10-26%20at%204.10.56%20PM.png)

    ... type in `java -version` into the window and hit enter
    - If you see `java version` as 1.8 or greater, you're good to go!


- **Android Studio**: Android Studio is the main integrated development environment (IDE) for Android Development. It'll allow you to create apps using XML and Java (the two primary programming languages for Android). Follow these steps to install Android Studio:

    - Go to <http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html>
    - Download Android Studio
    - Agree to Terms & Conditions
    - Launch the `.dmg` file that you just downloaded
    - Drag and drop Android Studio into the Applications folder


- **Setting Up Android Studio + SDK**: Now it's time to open up Android Studio and get it set up! This may take a little bit of time, depending on your internet connection:

    - Open Android Studio from your Applications folder
    - Click next on the welcome screen.
    - Click next for Java Settings (you should've installed Java already!)
    - Choose "Standard" for the install type, click next.
    - Click "Accept" for the SDK License Agreements as well as the `intel-android-extra-license`, click Finish.
    - Wait for the downloads to complete!
    - Click Finish.
