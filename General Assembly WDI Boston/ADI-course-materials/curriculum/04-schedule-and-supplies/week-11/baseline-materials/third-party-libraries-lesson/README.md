## Opening (5 mins)

So here's the thing: there is no magical list of libraries you need to know to be a successful Android Engineer. You don't _need_ to know any libraries outside of the ones provided by Android.

Honestly, libraries usually make your coding lives easier.

In this lesson, we will be discussing a few libraries that are useful, and talk about the pros and cons of libraries.

## Introduction: What are third-party libraries? (5 mins)

A library is a collection of pre-built classes, usually to aid you in accomplishing a particular goal.

[Volley](http://developer.android.com/training/volley/index.html), for instance, is an HTTP library that makes networking faster and, most importantly, easier than the standard HttpURLConnection.

An Software Development Kit (SDK) is a similar concept. It is a collection of libraries that will give you everything you need to develop a larger thing, like to develop a certain type of software.

The Android SDK is a collection of libraries, grouped together, to provide everything you need to create an Android app. The [Facebook SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android) is a collection of libraries that help integrate your software with the many modules of Facebook.

> Check: Can you think of any other libraries? Why are they libraries?

## Guided Practice: Pros and Cons of Libraries (10 mins)

> Check: For the next 3 minutes, with someone next to you, come up with a few pros and cons of using third-party libraries (not SDKs).

Well, ideally, using code libraries should be nothing but positive. However, this is not always the case.

Pros:

* Someone else wrote the code, so you don't have to do so!
* Faster to code your app
* Something that normally takes many lines of code is now just a few lines
* Usually, it is updated frequently.

Cons:

* Pros are not guaranteed
* Some libraries have a steep learning curve
* Some libraries don't simplify code
* You don't have access to non-open source libraries
* If the library has a bug, there isn't much you can do about it

> Check: Why do popular companies, like Square, have few cons?

## Demo: Third-party Android libraries (25 mins)

Think about the concepts that have been difficult to follow, or just took forever to do.

Some of which may be Content Providers, managing network calls with `HttpURLConnection`, and `AsyncTask`, etc.

Well, library coders (librarians?) have made code to make those things easier.

**The general rule**: If it's difficult to do, there's probably a library for it.

Since you're just starting in your Android careers, you probably want libraries to help with networking, data storage, or UI.

There are a lot of Android libraries out there, and so many of them range from completely unnecessary to "must use in all of my apps!"

> Instructor Note: For each of the 4-6 third party libraries you select, load the app(s) you prepared and explain the use case of the library and demonstrate how it's used in your application by showing a code sample or functionality.  Use the [assets/specific-libraries.md](assets/specific-libraries.md) examples for inspiration, if needed!

## Independent Practice: Brainstorm (15 mins)

Talk with the person next to you about functionality you'd like to build into your project and then search for third-party libraries to help you accomplish this.  Be prepared to share out.

## Conclusion (5 mins)

In the end, again, you don't need any of the aforementioned libraries. Most companies don't require that you know them because they are fairly easy and should not take too much time to learn. However, knowing these third-party libraries is still a very powerful trait.

- Identify some of the third-party libraries you found and how you would use them
- Describe the pros and cons of using a third-party library
