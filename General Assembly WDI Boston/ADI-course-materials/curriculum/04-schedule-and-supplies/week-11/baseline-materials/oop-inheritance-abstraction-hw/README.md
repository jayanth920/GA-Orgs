> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

This homework will provide you with some more practice on creating abstract classes, subclasses, and interfaces. You need to design an app that manages a school. The school has Classrooms, and the Classrooms have Teachers and Students assigned to them. Each classroom contains students in a single grade (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.).

The actions and properties of each class is up to you to decide.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- At least one abstract class
- At least one interface
- At least 3 subclasses
- Each subclass must be unique from the others

**Bonus:**
- Add extra classes/subclasses/interfaces

#### Deliverable

Java code for classes/interface(s) that meet the requirements above.
