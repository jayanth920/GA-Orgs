## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

In this lab, you will determine the time complexity of various algorithms in terms of their worst-case running times. You will express those running times in Big-O notation.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- For each of the four pseudocoded algorithms, determine the worst-case running time in Big-O notation
- Include an _**explanation**_ of how you arrived at your answer

**Bonus**

- Perform the same analysis for the fifth algorithm


#### Starter code

In the [starter code](starter-code) folder, you will find code for the four pseudocoded algorithms and the bonus.

#### Deliverable

Modify the pseudocode text file by adding the worse-case running time in Big-O notation and your explanation beneath each algorithm. Submit a pull request including your modified file. If you worked with a partner, put both names in the title of the pull request.
