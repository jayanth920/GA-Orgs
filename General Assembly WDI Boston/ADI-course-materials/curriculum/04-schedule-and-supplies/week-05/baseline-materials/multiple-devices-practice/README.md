## Exercise

You are provided with [6 pictures](screenshots), with each picture being a layout in either portrait or landscape. You will be expected to implement two sets of these layouts, with the third set being optional.

At least one of these layout sets should be shown on the screen, with the user able to rotate their device to see the portrait or landscape version of that layout.

#### Requirements

- Add your layout files (the multiple versions of cardlist and cal) in the appropriate folders in your Studio project
- When the project is installed on a device, it should show at least one of the portrait/layout sets.
  - i.e., if you open the app in portrait and it shows one of your layouts, rotating the device should show the landscape version of the layout.

**Bonus:**

- Using the bonus images in the [screenshots](screenshots) folder, create the layouts and put them in the appropriate folders.
  - Note: The bonus is using a RecyclerView, and showing the cards in a grid. Look at [Vogella's tutorial](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/AndroidRecyclerView/article.html) as a starting point.

#### Deliverable

An Android Studio project.
