## Exercise

Now that you have learned about the process of adapting your app to account for different types of devices and locales, it is your job to apply these skills to one of your previous apps. You will be creating unique layouts for portrait and landscape orientations of your project 2 app. Your landscape layouts should take advantage of the extra horizontal space in some way. In addition, you will be adding a second language translation of your choice for the app's static strings.

#### Requirements

- Add landscape layout files for your project 2 app
- Add an XML file for another language of your choice

**Bonus:**

- Add additional DPI images to account for all screen sizes

#### Deliverable

A modified version of your project 2 Android Studio submission.
