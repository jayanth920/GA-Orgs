## The Problem 

Everyday, women, children, people of color and members of the LGBQT community endure various forms of street harassment. Currently there are no laws protecting the right to be at peace in public, nor is there any data on how frequently this happens. Shamer's aim is mulit-pronged: First, to create a sense of community among victims of public harassment. Second, created a database that users can contribute to share their experience. Third, to hold perpetrators accountable for their actions by bringing to light when and where these instances are taking place. And finally, to present aggregate data to relevant organizations, allies and lawmakers so that we make make real change to the quality of life of many.

The current data on public harassment is limited, but they all point to a desperate need for change. 
  - A 2013 (http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/resources/statistics/) study of 93,000 LGBQT individuals in the European Union found that HALF avoided public spaces sometimes because of street harassment and most reported high levels of fear.
  - Studies tracking trans harassment and violence are even more disturbing, starting as early as the K-12 environment from peers and teachers. In a survey by The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force(http://www.thetaskforce.org/static_html/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf),  53% of respondents reported being verbally harassed or disrespected in a place of public accommodation and 8% reported having been physically assaulted.
  - We were unable to cite statistics regarding the harassment/stalking of children, but have reason to believe there is a connection between such behavior and child abductions/molestation/assault. Addtionally, child harassment can extend to bullying. One in four kids in the US have been bullied, which can lead to deeper developmental issues (decreased confidence, acting out, increased risk of suicide, etc).
  - Harassment against POC are well-documented in the workplace, however, stats on these incidents in public spaces are hard to find. This lack of information can serve as a problem the app can solve.

## The Solution 

Baseline Features for Demo 1:
  * map population of recorded instances
  * user log in
  * view self-reported instances + other users'

Bonus features we plan to implement if baseline features are completed in time:
  * location services: alerts when entering high-frequency areas
  * graph data statistics
  * sorting data on the map by date, shame type, time of occurrence, etc.
