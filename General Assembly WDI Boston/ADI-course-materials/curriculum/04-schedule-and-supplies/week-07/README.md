# Week 7: Data from the Web

First, we'll get students comfortable with JSON; then, we'll move to HTTP calls from the command line; finally, we'll move to network calls from Android and product development tactics to get students ready for project 3.

#### Weekly Instructor Prep

- Make sure students sign up for the Instagram API (they need to get approved for a lab on day 3)
- Create a HW assignment to have students experiment with clickable prototype tools for day 4 (they'll need it on day 5)
- Create teams of 3-4 students and assign them to particular project 3 "clients"; present teams on Friday morning
- Read through the email client lab; be ready to help students (this one is hard!)

#### Assessments (Bolded Below)

- Networking in Android Lab
- Build an Email Client
