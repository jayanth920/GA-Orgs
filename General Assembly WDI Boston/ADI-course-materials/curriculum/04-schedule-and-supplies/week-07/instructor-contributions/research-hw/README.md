Any time that we’re collecting data, whether qualitative or quantitative, we’ll need to bring it all together and make sense of it. We call this synthesizing.

This homework asks you to gather data about your users and introduce you to practices relating to synthesizing research: affinity maps, user personas, and user flow charts/story boards (all things we'll be doing during tomorrow's lesson).

## Exercise

#### Requirements

##### Part 1

- Use the research plan and the questions you developed with your teammates in class to interview two volunteers

  - These volunteers could be students, staff, classmates, family, friends, etc
  - Record the answers to your interviews in a markdown file and submit a pull request with that file inside this repository

##### Part 2

This part of the homework will prepare you for tomorrow...

**Affinity Mapping**

An Affinity Diagram is used to group data based on natural relationships. It allows for large numbers of ideas, or notes to be sorted into groups and reviewed for analysis. Here’s what one looks like:

Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swsat1e6yFk) video of an affinity map in real time

Background to Video: This Affinity diagram is from 500 pieces data gathered from users of the product we're about to redesign. By using inductive reasoning, the team coordinates to find clusters of meaning, then names them. This is a user-centered technique that guides the requirements-definition process in new product development. For more reading on our specific technique check out Karen Holtzblatt's book Rapid Contextual.

**User Personas**

Think about this question: “If your website were a person, who would it be?” - Aarron Walters, UX Director/Mailchimp

From here, we’re going to want to create "stereotypes" of our users. This will help us to shape our conversations and decisions around a target group of users. Remember: Personas are written in pencil, the more we build, the more we’ll learn.

**User Flows/Story Boards**

Before creating wireframes or designing screens you’ll want to understand your users behaviors and the ideal path for them to accomplish their goals. You’ll often hear the term “Happy Path” used to describe the most ideal, frictionless path a user can take to achieve an intended goal. Here is an example of a Facebook User Flow for determining how to comment on a post:

</p>

On a piece of paper, list the steps to your morning routine. What needs to happen between waking up in the morning and arriving to work or school? What does a perfect morning look like (Happy Path)? Does it vary depending on the day? What circumstances cause you to change? Using the Facebook example above, turn the list of To Do items into a chart diagramming the process. Take a picture and include this drawing in your pull request.

#### Deliverable

You should submit a pull request with your drawing of your user flow for your morning routine and a file with the notes from your user interviews.

_Note_: There are no deliverables for part two of the homework.
