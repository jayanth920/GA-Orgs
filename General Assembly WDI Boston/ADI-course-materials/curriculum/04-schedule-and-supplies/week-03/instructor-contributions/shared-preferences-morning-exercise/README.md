> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

## Exercise

This morning we're going to get some extra practice with SharedPreferences. In groups of 2-4, create a two activity app. The first screen will show at least two TextViews containing some text. The second activity is a settings activity that controls properties of the TextViews, such as font size and color. You may have the settings modify whatever text properties you would like.

You must store these settings in SharedPreferences in the second activity, and retrieve them in the first activity.

#### Requirements

- Create two activities
- One activity contains at least two TextViews, the other contains settings for the TextViews
- Store the settings in SharedPreferences, and use them to modify the TextViews

**Bonus:**
- Add as many settings options as you want!

#### Deliverable

A working app following the requirements above.
