# Organizing Information - Challenge Questions

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This should be completed independently._

In this lab, you will be completing a series of 3 challenge questions that involve data collections. These questions are very similar to what you would see in an interview, so this is great practice. Think through each problem before you start creating code, possibly writing out pseudocode if it will help you. Run your code against the included test cases when you are finished. **Feel free to look up any Java documentation to help you (ie arrays, Lists, etc.)**

**Although you can find answers to these on the internet, it would be to your benefit to try them on your own**

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Complete each question in its own provided method
- Your methods must pass all of the included test cases

**Bonus:**
- Complete the bonus question (Marked as Bonus)
- Optimize your methods to be more efficient

#### Starter code

An **intelliJ project** called ChallengeQuestions has been provided for you that includes a Main.java file. Each method has a comment above it that contains the problem. Complete each problem in that method (although you can write additional methods if it will help in your solution). Run your code against the test cases when you are done.

#### Deliverable

The completed Java file with solutions to the questions.


#### Test your code

Use the included JUnit test cases. Right click the file MainTest.java, and choose 'Run MainTest'.
