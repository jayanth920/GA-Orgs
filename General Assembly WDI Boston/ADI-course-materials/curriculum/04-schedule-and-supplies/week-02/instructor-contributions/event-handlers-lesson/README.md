## Opening (5 mins)

There are two primary components to handling input events from the user. The first component is something called an event listener. These register a View to respond to a certain user action, or "event". They "listen" for an event to happen, such as a press on the screen. The second component is the event handler. Event handlers are the pieces of code that actually process and act on the events that were being listened for.

>Check: Ask the student to give examples of Views we've seen (ie Buttons) and how we've handled input events (ie onClick with a listener).

## Introduction: Event Handlers (25 mins)

The two most common ways to work with event handlers are by listening for events on existing views built into Android, or by creating a completely custom View component and directly extending View (or its subclasses). We will discuss both but only implement the first, as it is what you will most commonly see.

Directly extending View leaves a lot of responsibility for you, the developer, to implement. You must initialize all components of the View (properties, colors, etc.), provide methods to measure the width and height of the View, and override the onDraw method which handles actually drawing your View on the screen.

If you are trying to create a custom component that is close to an existing View, such as an EditText, it is better to extend that more specific View. This provides a few key advantages. First, it minimizes the amount of methods you need to override, often just the ones that directly affect your modified functionality. Second, you can simply substitute your custom class for the built in class (ie CustomEditText instead of EditText). When you just extend View, you must define your custom components simply as a generic View.

Extending a View or one of its subclasses allows you to directly implement the method that handles the touch event, negating the need for a listener.

As we discussed earlier, the other way to handle events are with the combination of event listeners and event handlers. Some common event listeners we see are onClickListener and onFocusChangeListener, which have the respective handlers onClick() and onFocusChange(). Event listeners are tied to existing View objects through methods such as setOnClickListener, which accepts an onClickListener, which in turns implements the onClick event. This flow is actually displayed visually in your code, which we will see in the upcoming demo.

> Check: Ask the student to come up with some examples of custom views they think would be worth implementing, and what views they would extend to do it.


<a name="demo"></a>
## Demo: Listeners and Handlers (20 mins)

Our demo will involve a very simple listener which you have used in many of your daily apps: the onLongClickListener. As the name implies, it listens for a long click, or when you hold your finger down for an extended period of time on a component.

Let's start off with the basic listener:

```java
Button button = (Button)findViewById(R.id.button);

button.setOnLongClickListener(new View.OnLongClickListener() {

});
```

> Instructor Note: Ask the students what they think the event handler should be, and how it should be defined.

Now we need to pass an OnLongClickListener object to the setOnLongClickListener method. We use the new keyword, and let Android Studio automatically provide the methods we must override. In this case, it provides the onLongClick method:

```java
Button button = (Button)findViewById(R.id.button);
button.setOnLongClickListener(new View.OnLongClickListener() {
  @Override
  public boolean onLongClick(View v) {
    Toast.makeText(EventHandlersActivity.class,"Long Press handled!",Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
  }
});
```
As you can see, we take the action we want to do within the onLongClick method. All click listeners and event handlers follow this same basic flow, just with different names.

>Check: Ask the students to name the method to set the listener, what the listener is called, and the method that must be overridden for basic clicks on Buttons. (setOnClickListener,OnClickListener, onClick)

## Guided Practice: Event Handlers -  Button enabling (15 mins)

In this practice, you must test that the user has checked a checkbox in order to enable a button. If the button is unchecked, the button should disable again. This is used in systems such as registration forms where the user must agree to terms before they can register. Starter code is provided in the ButtonEnabling project.

> Check: Were students able to successfully solve the problem or complete the task?

<a name="ind-practice"></a>
## Independent Practice: Event Handlers (20 minutes)

In this independent practice, you must implement click listeners for the provided eight buttons to either change the text color to the color indicated on the button, or the background color to the color indicated on the button. The buttons are arranged in columns with labels to determine whether it will change the background or text color. If the user taps on the text label, the background should change to white, and the text to black. Starter code is provided in the ColorChooser project.

> Check: Were students able to create the desired deliverable(s)? Did it meet all necessary requirements / constraints?

## Conclusion (5 mins)

Event listeners and event handlers are the foundation of user interaction with most apps, so becoming familiar with all of the listeners provided by Android will make you a stronger developer. With very little code, you are able to create highly interactive apps for your users. Hopefully you also have a better understanding about how many of the interactions work with your favorite daily apps.
