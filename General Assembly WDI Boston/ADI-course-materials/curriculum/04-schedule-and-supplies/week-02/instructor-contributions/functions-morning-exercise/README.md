> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

## Exercise

#### Requirements

For more practice writing methods, try these problems from CodingBat:
- [Blackjack](http://codingbat.com/prob/p117019)
- [Build an array](http://codingbat.com/prob/p178353)
- [Word count](http://codingbat.com/prob/p117630)
- [Shift left](http://codingbat.com/prob/p105031)

Use CodingBat's built-in tests to check if your code works correctly.
We'll go over these problems together at the end of the exercise.

#### Deliverable

Nothing to hand in! Just work on your code in CodingBat until all the tests pass.
