# Week 8: Sharing Code and Data

We start off with a team workflow using Git and GitHub, then move into some Android-specific content, and finally, we'll take three days to get through content providers and sync adapters. Also, students will do more work in their groups, using product development strategies, to prepare for and pitch their ideas for implementing the third project.

#### Weekly Instructor Prep

- Make sure all of this week's labs occur in pairs so students can practice using Git/GitHub to work together
- Encourage students to each line up 2 people to perform user interviews with after class on day 3
- Come up with a HW assignment to have groups create user stories, wireframes, a group Trello Board, and officially start coding for project 3

#### Assessments (Bolded Below)

- Project 3 Pitch
- Build a Sync Adapter Lab
