## Exercise

In this homework, you will be creating your own Contacts Content Provider, complete with your own database for storing the Contacts. Each contact should have, **at the minimum**, a name and phone number. In addition to adding new contacts, the user should be able to see all contacts currently in their list. The overall design of the app is completely up to you.

- Two EditTexts (name and phone number) and a button to add the new contact
- Users can add contacts to their contact list
- Users can view all contacts in their contact list

**Bonus:**

- Add in the ability to update and delete specific contacts
- Include additional properties for your contacts

#### Deliverable

An app that meets the requirements above.
