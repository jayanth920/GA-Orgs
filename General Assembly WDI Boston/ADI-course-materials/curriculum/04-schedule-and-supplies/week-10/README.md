# Week 10: Computer Science Intro

In order to prepare students for their job search, we'll cover popular sort and search algorithms as well as big O notation; students will also have project time the second half of each day.

#### Weekly Instructor Prep

- Come up with presentation order for students to present during the pitches on day 4
- Think of your favorite whiteboarding problems to given students during this week's morning exercises


#### Assessments (Bolded Below)

- Binary Search Lab
- Big O Lab
