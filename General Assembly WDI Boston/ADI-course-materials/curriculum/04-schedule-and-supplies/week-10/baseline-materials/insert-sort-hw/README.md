## Exercise 1

Today, you learned about Insertion Sort. So tonight, you will be practicing it more.

Come up with two sets of numbers and sort them. These sets of numbers must have at least 5 numbers and cannot already be sorted beforehand. Also, they cannot be any sets of numbers we used during class.

Just like the [Bubble and Insertion Sort Lab](https://github.com/ga-adi/Bubble-and-Insertion-Sorting-Lab), sort as many as you can and make sure to show your work.

Show the result the sort after each pass.

#### Requirements

Provide the results of each pass. You can either take photos of the individual results that were written on paper or you can type them in a text file; both options are fine.

**Bonus:**

Sort the following string, using Insertion sort:

> G, e, n, E, R, a, L

#### Deliverable

A file or photos detailing all of the results.

## Exercise 2

Begin to think about what type of application you'd like to build for your final project.  Wednesday will kickoff our in-class final project time and having an idea ready will make it easy to jump into creating a research plan.

#### Deliverable

None for this part of the HW!
