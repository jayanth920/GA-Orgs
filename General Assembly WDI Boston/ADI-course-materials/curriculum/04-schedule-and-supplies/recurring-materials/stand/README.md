## Opening (5 mins)

> Instructor Note:  Only do this opening section during the first stand of the course.

"Stand" is a meeting that typically lasts between 5-15 minutes where attendees stand to keep the meeting "short and sweet".

From Wikipedia: "Some software development methodologies envision [stand] to make commitments to team members. The daily commitments allows participants to know about potential challenges as well as to coordinate efforts to resolve difficult and/or time-consuming issues."

Typically, stand involves each member of the team answering these three questions:

- What did I accomplish yesterday?
- What will I do today?
- What are my blockers (obstacles are impeding my progress)?

The first two questions help with accountability and as a way to reflect.  The final question can be addressed using help from other members of the team or a manager.

During your group project stands, the final question will be important in identifying what is holding you back from making progress on particular features and how group members or the instructional team might help.

## Guided Practice: Stand (15 mins)

> Instructor Note:  Split the class into groups of ~5 students and encourage students to go around the group and answer the three questions outlined above. Be sure to make your way around the room to listen in on different groups to make sure you make not of blockers and how you might be able to help.
