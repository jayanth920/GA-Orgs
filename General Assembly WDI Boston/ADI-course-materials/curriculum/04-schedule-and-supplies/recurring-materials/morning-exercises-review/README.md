## Introduction

Morning exercise time blocks are flexible time for the instructional team to use as they need.

## Exercise

Take the first 40 minutes of this time to do any of the following:

- a general review session
- a second pass on a particular topic
- a pair programming activity
- a whiteboarding activity or code challenge to get the class going
- an introduction to a topic that will be taught later in the day
- introduce a project: read over the project description, requirements, timeline, and deliverables and/or form teams for a group project
- take a course survey

The final 20 minute should be spent on reviewing any solutions from previous homework, labs, projects, or the exercise given that morning.
