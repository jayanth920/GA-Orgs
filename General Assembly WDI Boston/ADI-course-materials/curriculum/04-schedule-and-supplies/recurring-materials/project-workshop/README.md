## Introduction

Dedicate this session to project time for students.  They should free to work on whatever parts of their project they feel is necessary, or work on a particular part of the project according to the week's readme - for example, "Build out the UI of your project".

Support as necessary. Instructors should work with their producer or instructional coach to determine how to best support students during workshop time.
