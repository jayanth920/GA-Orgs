## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This lab should be completed in pairs and can be used for multiple mornings._

Use what you've learned from the whiteboarding lesson early in the course to work through a problem on the desks or walls in class.

## Exercise

The instructors will choose one technical interview question from one of the popular companies below, and in pairs, students will pretend they are in a whiteboarding session as part of an interview.  The student will play the interviewee, talking through the problem using the techniques we used in class, and the instructor will be the interviewer, asking and probing when appropriate.  Take 15-20 minutes and then the instructor will share his or her thoughts about went well, what needed work, and the solution.  After, the instructor will choose another problem and do it again.

While, this is taking place, students not working with instructors should be working on their final project.

> Instructor Note: Choose from one of the questions below for students to work through. Make note of what's going well for students and where they could do better.  Students who are not in a 1:1 whiteboarding session with a member of the instructional team should be working on their final project. 

#### Questions

1. [Rotate an array (Amazon)](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Amazon-com-Amazon-Software-Development-Engineer-Interview-Questions-EI_IE6036.0,10_KO11,47.htm) - Write a method that takes an array and a rotate number, to shift the elements in array according to the rotate number. Example: array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Rotating it by 2 equals [3, 4, 5, 1, 2].

2. [Almost a palindrome (Facebook)](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Given-an-unsorted-string-determine-if-it-can-be-presented-as-a-palindrome-MMO-True-DOOR-False-QTN_1413904.htm) - Given an unsorted string, determine if it can be presented as a palindrome. Example: MMO (mom) would return true. EIVRVRE (reviver) would return true. DOOR would return false.

3. [Boxes and Fruit (Apple)](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/There-are-three-boxes-one-contains-only-apples-one-contains-only-oranges-and-one-contains-both-apples-and-oranges-The-b-QTN_114922.htm) - There are three boxes, one contains only apples, one contains only oranges, and one contains both apples and oranges. The boxes have been incorrectly labeled such that no label identifies the actual contents of the box it labels. Opening just one box, and without looking in the box, you take out one piece of fruit. By looking at the fruit, how can you immediately label all of the boxes correctly?

4. [Longest subsequence (Facebook)](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-consecutive-subsequence/) - Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers

5. [Goldman Sachs](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Suppose-you-had-eight-identical-balls-One-of-them-is-slightly-heavier-and-you-are-given-a-balance-scale-What-s-the-fewes-QTN_10521.htm) - Suppose you had eight identical balls, except for one. One of them is slightly heavier and you are given a balance scale . What's the fewest number of times you have to use the scale to find the heavier ball?

6. [Reverse Linked List](http://www.java2blog.com/2014/07/how-to-reverse-linked-list-in-java.html) - Write a method that reverses a Linked List (the head becomes the last node, the previous last node becomes the head)

7. [Intersecting Linked Lists (Amazon)](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Write-an-algorithm-to-determine-if-2-linked-lists-intersect-QTN_215079.htm) - Write an algorithm to determine if 2 linked lists intersect. An intersection is defined by two Nodes pointing to the same Node in memory.

8. Draw out the database tables you would use for an app that manages a library.

9. Describe the classes you would need to create for an app that manages a library.
