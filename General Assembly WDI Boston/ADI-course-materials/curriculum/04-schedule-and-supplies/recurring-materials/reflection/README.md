## Introduction: Reflection (5 mins)

On Fridays, during your Android Development Immersive course, we'll take an hour to detach ourselves from the course content and reflect.  Our reflection will focus on the following questions:

- Individually, what was a highlight of this past week?
- Identify one area of improvement you'll be focused on for next week.
- Is there anything we've been doing very well?
- Is there anything you would like us to be doing differently next week?
- Please leave a shout-out for a classmate or classmates.

You will have time to document your answers to each of these questions in an online survey as well as discuss each question in a group setting facilitated by a member of the instructional team.

## Guided Practice: Reflection Part 1 (25 mins)

> Instructor Note:  Split the class into two groups and provide the following directions.

This class is going to be split into two groups:

- Group one will be given a link to an online survey provided by the instructor; for the next 25 minutes, think about and write in your answers to the questions in the survey.

- Group two will be further spit into two groups - each subgroup will have a discussion lead by a member of the instructional team.  The discussion will focus on each of the questions above.

> Instructor Note: Use your judgment on how long to focus on each discussion question.

The groups will be switched in the next section.

## Guided Practice: Reflection Part 2 (25 mins)

> Instructor Note: Switch the groups - students who were filling out the survey will now be in discussion groups led by instructional team members; students who were in discussion groups will now have 25 minutes record their thoughts and feelings in the online survey.

## Conclusion (5 mins)

The instructional team - and General Assembly - use all the information at our disposal to create the best experience possible for you and your classmates.  We will look over the responses to your surveys and use it to make informed decisions about how to structure flex sessions and, if necessary, make adjustments to aspects of the course.

> Instructor Note: Feel free to identify common themes during your group reflection periods, as long as they are appropriate.
