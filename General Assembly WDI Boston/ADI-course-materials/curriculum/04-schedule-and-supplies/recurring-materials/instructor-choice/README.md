## Introduction

Instructor Choice sessions are similar to morning exercises - the instructional team's discretion is key.  Choose an activity that is appropriate given the current state of the class. This session or assignment could take the form of any of the following:

- a general review session or exercise
- an session or exercise that offers second pass on a particular topic
- a pair programming activity
- a whiteboarding activity or code challenge
- an introduction to a topic that will be taught later in the course
- a survey
- an lesson, lab, or exercise that explores advanced topics

#### Requirements

- Up to the instructional team!

**Bonus:**

#### Starter code

You guessed it: if the activity you design requires starter code, include it!
