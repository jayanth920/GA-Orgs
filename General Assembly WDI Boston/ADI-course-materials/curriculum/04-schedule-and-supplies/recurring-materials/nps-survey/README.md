## Introduction

> Instructor Note: To ensure we're meeting our students' needs, three times/course, your course producer will come in and administer a longer survey, probing students about their in-class experience, the content, the instructional team, and the environment at General Assembly. Speak with your course producer to figure out your involvement in this process.
