This week is all about getting comfortable in Java, as students prepare to build a Rock, Paper, Scissors console game using only Java.

#### Weekly Instructor Prep

- Be sure to have your curriculum repository and GA organization set up
- Set up a form for the [reflection session](../recurring-materials/reflection) that can be shared and used by students

#### Assessments (Bolded Below)

- Writing Advanced Functions Lab
- Project 0
