## Java Development Kit

Before anything else, you need to install Java on your system. This can be a little tricky and requires a little bit of coding; don't panic and make sure to follow these steps closely:

1 ) Go to <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>

2 ) Download Java Platform JDK (see image below)

4 ) Make sure to accept terms & agreements

5 ) Open the `.dmg` file and follow installation steps

6 ) Verify that Java has installed successfully by opening the `Terminal` app on your Mac (you can search for Terminal using Spotlight search on your Mac)

8 ) If you see `java version` as 1.8 or greater, you're good to go!
