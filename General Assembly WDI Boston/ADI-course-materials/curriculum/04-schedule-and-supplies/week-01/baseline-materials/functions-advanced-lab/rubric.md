| Requirements | Incomplete (0) | Does Not Meet Expectations (1) | Meets Expectations (2) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Write a function that takes in a number and returns true if the number is even or false if the number is odd. You may use control flow and multiple conditionals. | | | |
| Write a function that takes in two words and compares them. If the spelling is the same, the functions returns true, otherwise false.| | | |
| Write a function that takes in a word and prints out its every letter on a new line before it sees the letter "w". If it encounters "w" the function should stop executing. | | | |
| Write a function that generates a random number. Print it out. If the number is greater that 50, return it, otherwise return -1. You may use control flow and multiple conditionals. | | | |
| Write a function that takes in 3 integers: day, month, and year and computes day, month, and year of the next day. The function should return a string (e.g. day:12 month:11 year:1988) | | | |
| Write a function that takes in a word, omits every other letter in that word and returns a new word. You can use control flow and multiple conditionals. | | | |
| Write a function that takes in a number greater than 5 and prints out all the numbers from 1 to that number except number 4. Please use a while statement. | | | |
| Write a function that takes in 2 numbers, and checks if they are the same. If they are not the same, it adds 1 to every number and returns its sum. If the numbers are the same, it adds 2 to every number and returns its sum. | | | |
| Write a function that asks the user to enter a country domain. If the user types in "us", the function prints out "United States", if the er enters "de", the function prints out "Germany", if the user types in "hu" the response should be "Hungary". In all other cases the nction should print out "Unknown". Please try to use a switch statement and make sure the function works with a user's input of lower and upper case strings. | | | |

Notes:

> Example: Your getting the hang of this!  Be sure to practice proper indentation and spacing.  Nice work! On line (INSERT SPECIFIC LINE NUMBER) in the (INSERT SPECIFIC FILE NAME) you (INSERT SPECIFIC CRITIQUE). Also, on line (INSERT SPECIFIC LINE NUMBER) in the (INSERT SPECIFIC FILE NAME) you (INSERT SPECIFIC CRITIQUE
