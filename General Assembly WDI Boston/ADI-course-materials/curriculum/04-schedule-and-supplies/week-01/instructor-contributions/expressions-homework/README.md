* You will practice writing expressions
* Revisit algebraic expressions and *order of operations*
* Research theorums and formulae used in the real world
* Convert formula that adhere to the *order of operations* to programmtic expressions

## Exercise

* Fork this repository and clone it to your computer.
* Inside of the [`expressions.java`](starter-code/expressions.java), write out each expression for this assignment.

#### 1. Order of Operations

1. Research the order of operations online (or write it out based on memory).
2. In the comments of `expressions.java`, leave a description of order of operations.
3. Describe the order in which operators/functions run.

#### 2. Operators Warm-up

1. Add 42 to 1
2. Multiple 0 by 981 and then add 68 times 8
3. Add 3.14 to 0.09 and then remove 12 from the total
4. Divide 89 by 4 to show only the remainder
5. Subtract 5.16 from 66.7128 and divide the results by 5

#### 3. Geometry

For some of these expressions, you may use variable placeholders in stead of values. Example: `(n + x)`

1. Express how to find the area of a circle as an expression
2. Express the pythagorithm theorum as an expression
3. Express how to find the area of a triangle as an expression
4. Express how discover the volume of a cube
5. Express how to find out how manyn milliseconds are in 14 minutes

#### 4. Brain Twisters (Bonus Challenge)

Some of these challenges will require that we assume variables currently exist. Feel free to be creative in writing these expressions.

1. Express how to calculate if a number equal in value to one third of another number
2. Express two linear equations that are equal to each other
3. Express how to discover the slope of a line

## Deliverable

When complete, add/commit/pull/push to Github and **create a pull request** to submit your homework.
