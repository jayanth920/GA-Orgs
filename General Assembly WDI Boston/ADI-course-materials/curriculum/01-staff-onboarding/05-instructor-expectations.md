The following document provides a set of basic guidelines for your responsibilities as an instructor.

## Planning Before the Course

We highly recommend you begin preparing your lessons at least 2-4 weeks before the course starts. A good benchmark is to prepare the first 5 - 6 lessons before the course actually begins.

During these preparation weeks you should:

- Review the high-level unit structure, lesson plans, project arcs, and instructor resources provided.
- Review the objectives as well as sample, starter, and solution code for each lesson, lab, and project.
- Read through our student feedback guide and review the rubrics for each project.
- Decide how you want to incorporate your experiences into lesson materials and deliverables.
- Update the slide decks for each lesson to correspond with the materials you plan to teach.


## Planning During the Course

Lead instructors should get out of the classroom for at least 2 hours per day to plan for class and grade student work.  These instructors should find this time during lessons they are not leading or during labs, after the activity has been introduced, as students should be working independently.

Also, at least 4 days before the start of each week, the instructional team should come together to decide who is responsible for preparing for and facilitating what lessons/labs during the following week.


## Communication

Set clear office hours and make yourself available to your students. Primary methods for communication include:
- Slack
- Email

### Slack: Expectations

Slack is a real-time messaging platform that allows you to communicate as a class. Your producer will set up a course channel for you on Slack, giving you and your students access to a global community!

You should use Slack to communicate as a class. It's extremely useful for taking attendance, notifying groups, or updating students 1:1.

Follow the instructions below to sign up for slack.

* Visit the following [site](https://slack.com/downloads) to download the application.
* Sign up using your email and join your class Slack channel.
* Upload a profile picture to Slack.

### Email: Expectations

You should reserve email for sending messages to the entire class or documenting specific issues with individual students.
