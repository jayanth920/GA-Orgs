Our goal is to provide meaningful suggestions and personal guidance to all of our students. While there will undoubtedly be nuances in how each of us evaluates student portfolio projects, using these guidelines will ensure that students get the personalized feedback they deserve.

## Course Standards

Our course teaches topics relating to the following standards:

1. User Interface - Work with the building blocks of Android’s user interface in order to add function and interaction in applications.
2. Programming Fundamentals - Use programming fundamentals in Java and XML to create functionality in an Android application.
3. Activities and Intents -  Create activities, and explicit intents, that allow users to navigate between activities.
4. Workflow and Dev Tools - Utilize mobile development best practices and industry standard tools to build an Android application and work on a development team.
5. Product Development - Work collaboratively with fellow developers in order to plan out an entire design sprint, from research, ideation, definition, and execution of an app idea.
6. Databases - Create, edit, read, and delete data held in a relational database and databases services in order to populate fields, lists, and content within an app.
7. Android Technologies and Services - Use Android-specific technologies and guidelines to add functionality and interaction in an app.
8. Testing - Incorporate unit, interface, and usability testing into a development workflow in order to ensure that the key components of an app function correctly.
9. Web Communication - Connect applications to the world wide web and send and receive data from servers on the internet.
10. Computer Science - Apply fundamental computer science concepts when storing and sorting data and in interview settings.

## Project Arc

Globally, we have 4 Projects and 1 Capstone Project. Each builds on top of previously learned skills to scaffold student performance.

### Project Specs

Each project includes objectives, requirements, a grading rubric, and suggested resources - all of which tie into the overall competencies for each unit. Dive into the detailed project spec files to read more about each project.

#### When should students be assigned Project X, Y or Z?

| Unit | Project | Assigned | Deadline |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- |
| **Unit 1** | [Project 0](../03-projects/project-00) | Week 1, Day 4 | Week 1, Day 5 |
| **Unit 1** | [Project 1](../03-projects/project-01) | Week 2, Day 1 | Week 3, Day 5 |
| **Unit 2** | [Project 2](../03-projects/project-02) | Week 4, Day 1 | Week 6, Day 5 |
| **Unit 3** | [Project 3](../03-projects/project-03) | Week 7, Day 5 | Week 9, Day 5 |
| **Unit 4** | [Project 4](../03-projects/project-04) | Week 10, Day 1 | Week 12, Day 5 |

## Grading Expectations

You should be using GitHub for student-facing materials, project submission, feedback, and grading.

In order to pass this course, General Assembly students **must**:

- Complete and submit 80% of all course homework assignments.
- Complete and submit the final project, including all 5 milestones.

---

## Rubrics

Rubrics are provided for all student projects to help provide students with structured feedback.

### Guiding Principles

- Prompts and rubrics are provided to **structure feedback for student projects**.
- Rubrics are based on a **simple 3-point scale** - "Incomplete", "Does Not Meet Expectations", and "Meets Expectations" - tailored for each project. (In some instances, "Exceeds Expectations" can be achieved, depending on the project/assessment requirement.)
- Metrics for "meets expectations" are clearly defined to help you provide **targeted feedback.**

### Feedback Guidelines

- Students should be shown a copy of the blank rubric when given their project prompt.
- Rubric categories and evaluation metrics should always be tied to project specifications.
- Instructors should work with their TA's to provide targeted feedback for **every** student.
- Students should receive feedback on their projects **within 2 - 4 days** after submission!

### Bonus

Bonus activities are meant to supplement and challenge advanced students.  Attempting the bonus activities **should not** affect a student's grade if they do not complete the bonus activity in a way that is satisfactory for the instructional team.  If a bonus activity is completed in a way that is satisfactory, the students can be awarded 1 additional point on their assignment for each bonus activity completed.

## Rubric Assessment Process

1. Make a copy of the relevant project rubric.
2. Score project requirements using rubric criteria.
  - _Note: Half points are ok (1.5) but beyond that, detailed percentages are unnecessary._
3. Enter any notes for specific project deliverables.
4. Enter any notes for overall student progress report, if applicable.

### Feedback Tips

- Provide precise praise
- Identify action step for improvement
- Give context as to why what action step is important
- End with a targeted question related to the action step, that tests whether the student has understood the feedback.
  - **Good Example**: 'Great work! Your code is well organized. Good use of breaking tasks into separate functions. I see that in your app.js file you used the variable name x on line 84. Consider using more descriptive variable names. As a code reviewer, this would jump out at me. I want to know what every variable contains just by looking at the variable name itself. I do see some other descriptive variables! If we were to refactor this code, what would you want to rename x on line 84?'
  - **Poor Example**: 'Great Work! You’re doing a good job with all this. Do you have any questions about anything?'

### In-Person Assessment Process

Instructors and TA's are encouraged to meet with students during office hours or one-on-one to review project feedback and discuss growth opportunities. Students should ideally have up to 30 minutes to review their project evaluation or do a code review with instructors and TA's during the week after project submission.

### Model / Code Review Tips

Code review is not troubleshooting time. Instead, the goal is to review code and talk about actionable feedback for enhancing the student's project in the future.

- __Student (10 mins)__: Have the student walk through and defend their project / model / code.

- __Student (10 mins)__: Have the student answer the following questions.
  - What do you like most about your project?
  - What would you change if you started from scratch?
  - What would you like to add when you have more time?

- __Instructor/TA (10 mins)__: Talk through the evaluation, and share a “glow and grow”.
  - Make it personal – what about the project was exciting or intriguing?
  - Share any highlights and positive areas (“glow”) where the student went “above and beyond” the requirements
  - Share growth areas around time management, workflow, or project approach
  - Share growth areas around technical skills and ways to remediate any difficulties the student encountered
  - Help the student prioritize and identify which growth area is most important to focus on before the next project.
  - Set 1 or 2 specific goals for the next project.
  - If you’re reviewing the second or third project with the student, ask them how they did against the goals they set previously?

- Finally, be sure to report a summary of your evaluations back to your team, so we can evaluate how the class is doing as a whole!
