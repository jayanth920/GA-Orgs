General Assembly provides all instructors with lesson plans, exercises, and documented instructions on how to run their course.  In this file, we'll describe the materials we provide and supplemental materials we recommend local instructional teams build on their own.

## What Does GA Provide?

#### 1. A Baseline Scope and Sequence

 We highly recommend making a copy of our baseline course scope and sequence represented on [this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/u1kyF2WT/adi-curriculum) and use your copy of this board to plan out your course. Take a look.  If you cannot access this board, please email (jay@) or Slack (@jaynappy) Jay Nappy.

#### 2. Daily, Weekly Supplies

In this repository, we've [supplied a folder](../04-schedule-and-supplies) for each week of the course - this folder includes a weekly schedule found in a readme.md file.

In these weekly folders, we also have folders with instructor materials, with various materials, for each [in-class lesson](#in-class-lesson-materials) and [lab](#in-class-lab-materials).  

Guidance on how to run recurring class activities, like presentations and reflection periods, are also provided in the recurring materials folder for each week.

###### In-Class Lesson Materials

As mentioned, each lesson exists in it's own folder.  We've provided the following for each lesson:

|Materials | Description
|----|---------|
| __readme.md__| This is our lesson plan that contains the lesson learning objectives, talking points, and in-class exercises; be sure to read through the lesson readme _thoroughly_ and adapt portions of the lesson - introductions, demo, guided practice, independent practice - to best fit your teaching style and subject matter knowledge. |
| __Starter Code Folder__| This is a folder with all the starter code students need for the lesson. You should share this folder with students before every lesson. Make the necessary changes if you are using different code.|
| __Solution Code Folder__| This is a folder with all solutions to in-class exercises. Share individual solution files as needed. Students should be provided with code solutions after exercises to have a reference. |
| __Assets__| This folder contains screenshots, images, diagrams, and worksheets. |

There is no such thing as a perfect lesson - be sure to put your own personal touch in the form of discussion questions, bonus activities, and anything you feel will create a better learning experience!

**Note:** You should not, however, modify the learning objectives.

## What Is Not Provided By GA?

To allow for instructor creativity and flexibility, we don't provide materials for every hour of every class, though we do our best **to pull in materials contributed by instructors** from various local campuses - these contributions can be found within each [weekly folder](04-schedule-and-supplies.md) in a folder named "instructor-contributions".

The weekly readmes will link out to these contributions from various local markets, for homework assignments, exercises, bonus activities, and optional lesson/labs.  We strongly encourage you adapt what others have created and/or build your own supplemental materials that are not provided by GA.  

Here's a list of what is **not** provided by HQ for this course:

- **Homework assignments** - Homeworks are structured similar to labs with a readme file that provides context and requirements; students are not usually provided with starter or solution code; homeworks have been gathered from local markets and various examples of homeworks created by instructors can be found in the weekly instructor contributions folders
- **Morning exercises** - These can be assigned as homework or given during the first session of the day from 9-10am; they are structured similar to labs with a readme file that provides context and requirements; starter and solution code is optional; morning exercises have been gathered from local markets and various examples of morning exercises created by instructors can be found in the weekly instructor contributions folders
- **Review sessions materials** - Each week, there is a given amount of time dedicated to review; use these to take a second pass at teaching a particular topic or even as a more structured lab to get students more practice with skills or concepts from the week.
- **Instructor choice** - Also, there are sessions marked as "Instructor Choice"; use these sessions to teach about topics you *love*, exciting new technologies or tools, or even as an additional review session, if needed.
- **Outcomes sessions** - These sessions will be facilitated by your local outcomes team. As an instructor, you __should not__ have to create content for these sessions.
- **Project workshop sessions** - These are free-form sessions to provide students with ample time to code.
