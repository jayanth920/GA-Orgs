## Required Tools
Before the course starts, you should install and familiarize yourself with the following technologies:

- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)** - In addition to creating a GitHub account, you'll also need to install the command line tools for Git. Windows users should [install Git Bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io)
- **[GitHub](www.github.com)** - Weâ€™ll be using GitHub on a daily basis to store and share our code
- **[Android Studio and SDK Tools](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)** - We will be using Android Studio and
- **[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)** - The most widely deployed database engine in the world.
- **[Trello](https://trello.com)** - Flexible way to visualize tasks, project management, and product development.

## Optional Tools
These tools aren't required, but they offer some additional functionality that some students may find helpful!
- **[IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)** - Java IDE; can be used to teach introductory Java topics.


## Technology Policy

ADI introduces students to web development and programming using the environment, tools and ethics of the open-source community. We use the default environment and toolset for this (as well as the standard for computer science education): ___\*nix___ (Unix-like). We also only use languages and tools that are open-source and free for commercial use.

## Laptop Policy

Instructors must lead the course using Mac laptops. We strongly suggest that students use Mac laptops, as we perform all of our examples in, and use, Mac OS every day.

It is also our experience that students should have laptops with screens of at least 13-inches. Having an 11-inch screen will adversely affect student performance in class.

Instructors can only affirm their active support for students using Macs. Please see Operating Systems Policy below for further details.  

## Operating Systems Policy

**Mac:** We require students using Mac laptops to be able to run Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, in order to run all of the programs necessary for the course. This rules out some older versions of MacBooks from circa 2006-2007.

**Linux:** We allow students to use (Debian-based) Linux **only** if they are previously familiar with it and express understanding (in writing) that we will not generally be able to support them with technical issues or anomalies that they may encounter between their Linux environment and the Mac environment in which we teach the course.

We have found that when students use Linux, there ends up being a disproportionate amount of time that instructors are required to spend troubleshooting, and this is unfair to the experience of the rest of the class. If a student *has previous experience with Linux* and is willing to provide their own IT support, then we suggest that they use Ubuntu with its built-in Unity desktop, due to its simplicity and its similarity to the Mac OS X interface.

**Windows:** We do not allow students to use Windows during ADI, as Windows does not run in a \*nix environment. Students should not be allowed to arrive at Orientation or class with a computer running *only* the Windows operating system.

> Note that an addendum is being added to the enrollment agreement asking students to select either:

> - [ ] I will be bringing a computer running Mac OS X 10.8 or above
> - [ ] I will be using a computer running Ubuntu, am previously familiar with Linux, and I understand that I will need to provide my own IT support during class

## Platforms, Tools, and Applications

This course teaches students how to be an Android Developer. This field is constantly evolving, and every problem has many solutions. Each of these solutions is
implemented by a myriad of tools. A broad introduction to every one of these would be impossible for a single course, and we have committed to working together to define best practice for our classrooms.

General Assembly has a set of core objectives for the course, along with guidelines for instructors as to how to ensure students reach these objectives. These guidelines include recommendations on the sequence of the course and the software platforms, tools, and applications that serve as the current default for this course worldwide. As an instructor, you have the opportunity and responsibility to work with your local team to make sure you adapt these recommendations to your local context and chart a precise path to help your students achieve the core competencies that ADI covers.
