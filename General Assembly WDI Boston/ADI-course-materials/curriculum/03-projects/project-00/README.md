#### Overview

Let's put your Java knowledge to use! You're going to be creating a basic version of Rock Paper Scissors that you play against the computer in the console. The game consists of two main features:

- Play Rock Paper Scissors against a computer player
- View previous game history

**Hint:** Use a [random number generator](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Random.html) to pick the computer's choice.

#### Requirements

Your work must:

- Have a main menu with options to enter "play" or "history":
  - If the user enters "play", they should be able to play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer
  - If the user enters "history", the program should display previous game history
- Handle invalid user input
- Use Arrays or ArrayLists to store game history

**Bonus:**

- Handle incorrect capitalization of otherwise valid user input (rock, Rock, RoCk, ROCK, etc.)
- Store game history across sessions

#### Code of Conduct

As always, your app must adhere to General Assembly's [student code of conduct guidelines](../../../resources/guidelines/code-of-conduct.md).

If you have questions about whether or not your work adheres to these guidelines, please speak with a member of your instructional team.

#### Necessary Deliverables

Submit a pull request with a Java program that meets the above requirements.

Below, you can see sample output:

```

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Donâ€™t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems
- Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer
- Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

### Useful Resources

#### Project Feedback + Evaluation


Based on the requirements you can earn a maximum of 8 points on this project. Your instructors will score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
