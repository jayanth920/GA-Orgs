## Pre-Course Responsibilities

We highly recommend you begin preparing your lessons at least 2-4 weeks before the course starts. A good benchmark is to prepare the first 5 - 6 lessons before the course actually begins.

During these preparation weeks you should:

- Review the high-level unit structure, lesson plans, project arcs, and instructor resources provided.
- Review the objectives as well as sample, starter, and solution code for each lesson, lab, and project.
- Read through our [student feedback guide](project-feedback.md) and review the rubrics for each project.
- Decide how you want to incorporate your experiences into lesson materials and deliverables.
- Create / update slide decks to correspond with the materials you plan to teach.
  - We recommend using [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#full-setup) to automatically generate slides from external markdown files.

> Note: We recommend that you follow the lesson structure provided as a baseline, but feel free to add or supplement the curriculum with materials based on your experience and students' comfort level. If you'd like to suggest future curriculum revisions, please see [our contributing guidelines](contributing-guidelines.md).
