# Django Study

When we worked with JavaScript, we used the Express framework to build routes
and other functionality into our backend applications. In Python there are
similar frameworks we can use. Django is one of the most popular backend Python
frameworks, supporting lots of built-in features like an admin content
management system, browsable API, and more!

## Prerequisites

- Experience with API frameworks like Express
- Experience with the Python programming language

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

- Explain the purpose of Django and the Django Rest Framework
- Identify the pieces of an MVC framework
- Define serializers in relation to Django and DRF

## Instructions

This study will walk you through several brand new concepts - one of those
will be the idea of having "virtual environments" for our projects when
working with Python packages like Django. During this program, we will
keep it simple by just having one virtual environment for all Django-related
work.

Before you clone this repository, create a new folder in your `sei`
directory named `django-env`, then move into this new directory.

```sh
cd sei
mkdir django-env
cd django-env
```

Inside of this folder, you can run through the regular preparation steps below.

> Note: We will do all of our Django work inside of this new `django-env`
> directory. That means any lessons, projects, labs, or homework should be
> cloned or created inside this folder.

1. Fork and clone this repository **into the new `django-env` directory**.
1. Change into the new directory.
1. Create and checkout a new branch, named `response`.
1. Follow the directions given in [`exercise.md`](exercise.md).
1. When finished, push to your fork and submit a pull request.

Your pull request description should contain a "fist to five" for comfort and
clarity. Additionally, you should mention the resources you used to help you
complete this diagnostic. For example:

```md
Comfort: 3
Clarity: 3

I used Google and my class notes to help with this exercise.
```

cloning](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone), and [pull
requests](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/PullRequest).

You may use **any resource** other than each other to complete this exercise.
This includes referencing talk materials, appropriate documentation, and
searching for help online.
