# Ruby File I/O Demo

Start with the `load_fruit.rb` file. This file demonstrates loading items from a file into Ruby one line at a time.

The `log_fruit.rb` writes to the same file.

The `load_people.rb` shows how to use a comma separated value file without an external library to load the people and their ages into an array of hashes. There's no significance to the extension of .csv, except that it is convention to signify a comma separated file.
