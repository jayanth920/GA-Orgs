# Guide Template

Use this template to structure your READMEs for guides. Remove text from this section, or use it to frame the guide. Good framing answers the question "Why am I learning/doing this?".

Be sure to include a recent LICENSE and Markdown linter configuration (.remarkrc). Also, include an appropriate .gitignore; these are usually found in specific technology templates, for example js-template.

## Prerequisites

-   [ga-wdi-boston/rails-api](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api)
-   [ga-wdi-boston/rails-activerecord-crud](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/rails-activerecord-crud)
-   This guide assumes you have followed [these installation instructions](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-template#installation) unequivocally.

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

    Write objectives that focus on demonstrating knowledge.
    Write learning objectives that begin with an imperative verb.
    Avoid objectives that start with "Use" or "Understand".
    Rewrite objectives that begin with "Use" by inverting sentence structure.
    End each objective with a period.


## Getting Set Up

Often there will be setup instructions preceding the core objectives of the setup guide, such as `create an account on foo or bar`
The following is an example using heroku.

1.  **Create a Heroku account**, at [https://www.heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com).
    You will be sent an activation email, so be sure to check your inbox so that
    you can activate your account.
1.  Install the Heroku Command Line Tools: run `brew install heroku`.
1.  **Log into Heroku** by running `heroku login` from the console and providing
    your Heroku credentials when asked. Once you log in, if you're prompted
    to add these credentials to your keychain, say yes. *You will not be able*
    *to see your password*


### Create a New Heroku App

Go to the root of your repo and run `heroku create`. This will create an
_autogenerated_ name for your app, and add a new remote repository to your repo
 called _heroku_. View your remotes by typing `git remote -v`. You should see
something like:

```sh
    heroku  git@heroku.com:agile-badlands-7658.git (fetch)
    heroku  git@heroku.com:agile-badlands-7658.git (push)
    origin  git@github.com:tdyer/wdi_4_rails_hw_tdd_hacker_news.git (fetch)
    origin  git@github.com:tdyer/wdi_4_rails_hw_tdd_hacker_news.git (push)
```

### Push `master` to Heroku

Only keep clean, working code on `master`. After you complete a feature merge it
onto `master`. Push your updated `master` to GitHub, then to Heroku.

```sh
git checkout master
git merge my-feature # merge your working code
git push # update GitHub
git push heroku master # udpate heroku
```

### Update Heroku's Database

Once you've deployed your code, you can safely run new migrations. You'll need
to do this step every time you have new migrations.

```sh
heroku run rake db:migrate
```

If you have seeds or examples, or if you've updated seeds or examples, you
should also run them on heroku.

```sh
heroku run rake db:seed
heroku run rake db:examples
```

### Set your Secrets

Set your environmental variables in your heroku app.

```sh
heroku config:set SECRET_KEY_BASE=$(rake secret)
```

```sh
heroku config:set SECRET_TOKEN=$(rake secret)
```

```sh
heroku config:set CLIENT_ORIGIN=https://yourgithubname.github.io
```

### Check Your Work

Restart your application and check it out in the browser.

```sh
heroku restart
heroku open
```

You'll probably see something like this:

<img width="599" alt="herokuapp_png_1_366x768_pixels" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/388761/13259005/93c9fdf6-da23-11e5-9c90-19c59580944a.png">

That's normal, **unless** you have defined a root route.

### Change Your App's Name (optional)

If you wish you can rename your app at any time. It must be unique across all
apps deployed to heroku.

```sh
heroku apps:rename newname
```

Your app will become immediately available at it's new subdomain,
`newname.herokuapp.com`.

## Heroku Command Reference

A full list of Heroku commands can be access by running `heroku --help`; below

## WARNING: Ephemeral Filesystem.

One serious limitation of Heroku is that it provides an 'ephemeral filesystem';
in other words, if you try to save a new file inside the repo (e.g. an uploaded
image file), it will disappear when your app is restarted or redeployed.

As an example, try running the following commands:

```sh
heroku run bash
touch happy.txt; echo 'is happy' > happy.txt
cat happy.txt
```

Then, hit Ctrl-D to get out of heroku bash shell. If you re-open the shell and
run `ls -l`, `happy.txt` will be missing!

The typical workaround is to save files in cloud storage such as [Amazon
S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/); more on this in the near future.

## Setup Guide: Checklist

Provide checklist of steps outlined above.

-   [ ] Run `heroku create` in the command line in the root of your Rails API to
create a new (blank) app on Heroku.
-   [ ] Push your latest code to Heroku (`git push heroku master`)
-   [ ] Update your heroku database by telling Heroku to run your migration files (`heroku run rake db:migrate`).
If you have any other rake tasks that need to run (e.g. `rake db:seed`), run
those with `heroku run` as well.
-   [ ] Set your secrets. (Either by using the [command line](#set-your-secrets) or by using the
heroku app panel in your browser)
-   [ ] Check your work by restarting heroku and opening your heroku application.


## Troubleshooting

Provide troubleshooting resources/gotchas if needed.

These are the commands required for deploying to heroku with rails. If your heroku deployment isn't working as expected, review these steps carefully.
- `heroku create`
- `git push heroku master`
- `heroku run rake db:migrate`
- `heroku run rake db:seed`
- `heroku config:set SECRET_KEY_BASE=$(rake secret)`
- `heroku config:set SECRET_TOKEN=$(rake secret)`
- `heroku config:set CLIENT_ORIGIN=https://yourgithubname.github.io`
