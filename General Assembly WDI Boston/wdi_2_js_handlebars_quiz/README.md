# Quiz: Handlebars

## Directions

Max realizes that you guys are a source of free labor, so he has tasked you with rendering lists of his favorite things.

* Fork and clone this quiz.
* Write your answers in the `quiz.js` file.
* You have 20 minutes. When you're done, commit your work and make a pull request.
* Feel free to use your notes and Google, but you should work by yourself (not with a partner).
* Also feel free to run your code in the browser to check if it works!

#### Question 1:

Max's favorite foods are are being console logged as an array. Write all of the necessary code on `index.html` to render them.

#### Question 2:

Max wrote all of the html to render his favorite songs, but he forgot how to write the necessary javascript! Fill in `function _renderSong`.

#### Question 3:

Stupid Max. He forgot ALL of the code to render his favorite movies! Good thing he has you guys available to do the work for him. HINT: if you look at `lib/db.json`, you will see that the 'writers' holds an array of writer objects, each with their own name attribute. How do we iterate through objects?
