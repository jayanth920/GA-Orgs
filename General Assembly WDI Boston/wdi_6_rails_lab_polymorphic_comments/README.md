# Polymorphic Associations Lab

Polymorphic associations are where you can have one model associate to multiple other models.

This is really useful for allowing a behavior (like uploading an image) to exist on multiple models with minimal code duplication.

### Assignment

Amplifiers, Headphones and Speakers are all pretty cool, but I'd like for people to be able to leave anonymous comments on them. Create a Comment model, views and controller and make it so that anyone can leave a comment on any of them.

### Note

I used **scaffolding** to create the basis for this application. This was used to create a quick and consistent set of code for you to work on, but you are *not* allowed to use the scaffold generator in class for any homework, lab or project unless stated specifically by an instructor. We will notice, and they are recommended for you to not use them in production ever.

### Bonus 1

As a user, I should be able to upload images using Paperclip on Amplifiers, Headphones and Speakers. [There is an excellent tutorial for doing this on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/paperclip-s3).
