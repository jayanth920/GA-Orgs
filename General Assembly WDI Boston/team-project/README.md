# Building a React application with an Express API as a Team

You’ve already worked in small groups to accomplish various labs and exercises,
but this time **we’re going to challenge you to work on a whole project in a
small team.**

Not only will you be asked to **exercise additional creativity** in designing
your own project, your consultants will partner you with other classmates to
architect, design, and collaboratively build an API of your own design.

This project you'll be building something exciting with a **React client** and an **Express and
MongoDB API.**

**This is meant to push you both technically and collaboratively.** It’s a lot
harder to work in a team than to work by yourself, but that's most likely what
you’re going to find yourself doing in your first development job after SEI,
and **it's important to learn how to work together.**

Make it work, and make it awesome.
