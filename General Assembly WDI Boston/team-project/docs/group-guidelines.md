Group Project Guidelines
========================

> From _All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten_ by Robert Fulghum:
>
> - Share everything.
> - Play fair.
> - Don't hit people.
> - CLEAN UP YOUR OWN MESS.
> - Say you're SORRY when you HURT somebody.

TLDR; The Rules
---------------

- You must not work alone.
- You must not work quietly. Communication is very important for managing expectations.
- Develop your plan together.
- Identify dependencies between tasks so you know what to work on first.
- Do not work on more than one task at a time.
- You must record your decisions and share them with the group.
- You must respect group decisions.
- Everyone participates in code review before a merge.
- Everyone must be present for merges. No one works on tasks while merge conflicts are being resolved.
- Have regular standups.
- Have regular retros.

But, Why?
---------

Working in teams is an integral part of modern software development. There are considerable differences between working in a team on software and other group projects you may have worked on in the past. Though the group as a whole is responsible for making a product, each individual member is expected to contribute to the product by providing insight, quality assurance, and (of course) producing code. In software, there's always another task to complete, and it's tempting to work on many tasks at once. However, we're not just racing toward a finish line. Software is never complete.

In software teams, each member is valuable in part because of their unique experience and perspective. If the team is to succeed, knowledge gaps need to be filled. By sharing knowledge, we decrease what we call the "deltas" or differences in knowledge and specialties among team members. The best software teams are a mix of junior and senior members, the junior members providing what is called "beginner's mind" and senior members providing the technical know-how to solve difficult problems.

With these things in mind, here are some tips for ensuring each team member contributes in whatever capacity they can:

* Always pair. This is crucial for decreasing deltas.
* Pairs should work on one task at a time.
* Ask questions of your pair if you are leading.
* If you are following, interrupt your pair when you don't understand a decision.
* If you are leading, answer your pair's questions with reasoned responses, not "gut feeling".
* If either pair wants to experiment, entertain that desire **even if you disagree**, but time-box the experiment.

The group, being made up of individuals, is a collection of relationships. The group as a whole can be described in many of the same ways its members can: it is healthy or not, efficient or slow, happy or upset. As a collection of relationships, the group is either functional or dysfunctional. Here are some tips for maintaining group cohesion:

* Have a stand-up meeting every morning. The purpose of this meeting is to review progress and set priorities for the day. Each member answers the following questions before discussing goals for the day as a group:
    * What did you work on yesterday?
    * What do you plan on working on today?
    * What is blocking you?
    * Can you help someone else who is blocked?
* Have a retro at the end of each day. The purpose of this meeting is to share progress made to keep team members up-to-date. Retros are also valid places for sharing feelings, such as excitement, frustration, or overwhelm. A retro usually consists of "glow, grow, and shout outs".
    * "Glow" is something that went really well that day.
    * "Grow" is something you would like to see change.
    * "Shout outs" are public thanks to a team member who deserves recognition.

In addition to maintaining group cohesion and individual satisfaction, communicating regularly ensures transparency and ensures all voices are heard. You'll find it also helps avoid merge conflicts! Happy hacking.
