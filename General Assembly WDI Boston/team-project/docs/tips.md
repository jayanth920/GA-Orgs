## General



You **should**:

-   **Pair on everything!** Work with a teammate (or more!) on everything. It
    almost always leads to a better product, and improves everyone's comfort
    level in all technologies used. When you do add the github username of
    the person(s) you paired with to the end of your commit(s)!
-   **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
-   **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use**.
-   **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the
    logic of something helps.
-   **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful**.
-   **Be consistent with your code style.** You're working in teams, but you're
    only making one app per team. Make sure it looks like a unified effort.
-   **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because
    you can always go back in time to a previous version.
-   **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories
    focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
-   **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your
    naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at
    your app and understand what everything is?
-   **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find
    the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
-   **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each
    block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what and why means
    someone else can pick it up and get it.

**Good luck and happy hacking!**
