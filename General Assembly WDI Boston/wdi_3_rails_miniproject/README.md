# Week 3 Rails Miniproject

Take a project of your choice (a lab, a homework, or something new) and make it as good as you can. Spend some time on both the *functionality* (routes, models, controllers) and the *design* (views, HTML, CSS). 

At minimum, your code should be in a working state, even if it doesn't do all the things you intended it to do. 

Remember to make lots of git commits with helpful commit messages! Making lots of commits also helps with keeping code in a working state, so if something breaks, you can easily go back to the last point when your app was working.

## To submit your work 

Please deploy your code to Heroku and then submit a pull request. In your pull request message, paste in your Heroku URL (otherwise we have no idea where to look for it).
