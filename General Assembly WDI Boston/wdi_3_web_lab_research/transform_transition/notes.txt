CSS 3 transforms/transitions

transitions: go back and forth between two styles in CSS when you click/hover/focus on an element, SMOOTHLY

"CSS Transitions allow property changes in CSS values to occur smoothly over a specified duration. This smoothing animates the changing of a CSS value when triggered by a mouse click, focus or active state, or any changes to the element (including even a change on the elementâ€™s class attribute)."

transform applies either a 2d or 3d transformation to an element. allows you to rotate/scale/move/skew based on specified values (x axis, y axis, z axis for 3d).
CSS transforms can technically be done using other web technologies, but maintainability of other methods for simple element transformations is a drawback, so css is preferable. they are easy to work with and have very little if any unnecessary javascript involved.

also, support for css transforms is relatively strong across all browsers with decent market share. the only exception is IE - any version below 9. IE 6-8 can support transforms with the help of a jquery plugin, if need be.
