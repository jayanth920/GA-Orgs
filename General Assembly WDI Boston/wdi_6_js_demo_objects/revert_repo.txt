I've reverted the changes made in this repo for the following
reasons. The TDD changes are saved in the jasons_updates branch.

1. Don't use tests before they are explained. No magic.

2. Restore diagrams that are crucial to understanding __proto__ property.

3. Don't use strict mode until we explain it. Good for students to see
how most javascript they will encounter behaves. This is javascript
written without script mode.

4. Students to get to know Brower tools, e.g. Chrome inspector.

5. What students to interact with the, sometimes hidden, __proto__
property of object literal. Not sure if this is available in test
environments, e.g. Phantom.
