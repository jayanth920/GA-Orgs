### Standing Requirements

In order to get a satisfactory score, by the time you present your project, you
**must**:

-   Present **working browser game, built by you**, hosted on GitHub Pages.
-   Do all the things we require of ALL projects
-   Do all the things we require of ALL `clients`


Here's a sample from game-project...



    -   Sharing your work through a **git repository hosted on Github**.
    -   Making **frequent, cohesive commits** dating back to the very beginning
        of the project with **good commit messages**.

-   Produce **documentation** in the form of a **README**, which must:

    -   **Link to your hosted game** in the **URL section** of your Github
        repo.
    -   **List technologies used**.
    -   **Document your planning** and tell a story about your **development
        process** and problem-solving strategy.
    -   **List unsolved problems** which would be fixed in future iterations.
    -   Link to **wireframes and user stories**.

Your app **must**:

-   Be a **single-page** application.
-   Use a custom game engine **written by you**.
-   **Be deployed online**, where the rest of the world can access it.




Your app **must not**:

-   Rely on **refreshing the page** for **any** functionality.
-   Display **non-functional** buttons, nor buttons that **do not successfully
    complete** a task.
-   Have **any** user-facing **bugs**.
-   Allow players to move in the same square **more than once**.
-   Change players when an **invalid move** is made.

Additionally, you **should**:

-   Use **semantic** HTML.
-   Practice separation of concerns by:

    -   Using the [browser-template](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/browser-template) to
        store HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the appropriate places.
    -   Storing DOM manipulation code and network code in separate files.

-   **KISS (Keep It Stupidly Simple)**.
-   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**.
-   **Assume player X is the first player to start the game**.

Finally, you **should not**:

-   **Use alerts** for anything.
-   **Display errors** or warnings in the console.
-   **Display debugging** messages in the console.
