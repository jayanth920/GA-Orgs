# Plagiarism in Software Development

During the General Assembly bootcamp, we understand the practical need to use code from the internet. We routinely use Open Source projects, search documentation for usage examples, go to Stack Overflow for code snippets, and set you up with project templates as a starting point for your projects.

When learning to program, we will tell you not to "reinvent the wheel". Except for the sake of learning and practicing, writing your own solution when an existing one exists for you to use can be a big waste of time, and can even lead to vulnerabilities and bugs in complex code, like authentication. We routinely rely on frameworks, libraries and software packages to enhance the features of our applications. 

For example, the Ruby on Rails framework contains open source code that is free to use, modify and redistribute, without the need for any citations, because it carries the [MIT License](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/MIT-LICENSE). The requirements of this license are to include this license with the source code as it travels around from project to project. 

Generally, you are safe to include, modify, and redistribute in your own project's open source code. However, the open source project may have a license that should be included and the requirements followed. This is how software becomes more advanced over time, layers upon layers are built on top of each other, merged together, and efficiencies are achieved by relying on previously developed bodies of work.

Just like any other job or school where you create your own unique body of work, the same rules apply to software development. [Source code is treated the same as a literary work](https://www.stop-source-code-theft.com/is-source-code-intellectual-property/), and is intellectual property of the creator. When you are using the ideas or words of another and passing them off as your own, you are acting dishonestly. Code can be protected by copyright law. Using copyrighted or licensed material in such a way as not intended by the creators is considered plagiarism. Read more about what constitutes [plagiarism](https://www.plagiarism.org/article/what-is-plagiarism). 

So, where do software developers draw the line with what is regarded as plagiarism and what is using common knowledge, or what are the acceptable levels of using other people's work? In general, you want to respect the creator, and give credit where credit is due. More specifically, this means following through with licensing requirements, being honest, and giving attribution within your source code when using other people's code.

Plagiarism as it relates to software development is a complicated and serious topic about which many books could be and have been written. It carries real-world consequences and penalties. Plagiarizing, or copying someone else's work and passing it off as your own, can affect your standing and reputation during the bootcamp and potentially into the workplace and your professional career.

While copying someone else's work can appear to be common and accepted in the software development community, strict guidelines on how and when you can safely use someone else's work still exist. When you do choose to use someone else's code, we want to help developers do so correctly, by only using code that has been made available to them, and to properly attribute code to its creator.

## What Plagiarism Looks Like at GA

General Assembly has a strict policy against plagiarism during assignments and projects. If you are found to have plagiarized, you could be removed from the program.


### What We Consider Plagiarism

As an educational institution, we take plagiarism very seriously. We expect you to do your own work, and by no means value a 100% complete project or assignment over something that is the results of your own effort. We want to see your work, the results of your efforts, and yours alone, so that we can better guide you on your path.

All of the following are considered plagiarism or cheating and will not be tolerated.

- Turning in work that is not your own.
- Turning in someone else's work as your own.
- Hiring, or paying someone to do your work for you.
- Copying words or code without giving credit.
- Building or copying someone else’s idea without their knowledge or giving credit.
- Copying solutions directly from the solutions branch of an assignment
- Giving incorrect information about a source.
- Changing words, variable names, etc. but copying the code or files of a source without giving credit.
- Copying so many ideas or code blocks from a source that it makes up the majority of your work, whether you give credit or not.
- Failing to put a quotation in quotation marks. 

Notes:

- A source can be considered anything found on the internet (i.e. Stack Overflow, GitHub, etc.), an instructor, or another classmate.

- Plagiarism is NOT the same as copyright infringement

### The GA Code of Conduct

The specifics of what you have already agreed to:

Page 35 of the Code of Conduct states:

"General Assembly has a zero tolerance policy towards plagiarism and cheating. It is destructive to classroom culture, and exhibits a clear lack of respect for classmates, instructors, the company, and the greater community. Any work considered to have been plagiarised will not be accepted and will not count towards graduation requirements. If a project exhibits evidence of plagiarism or cheating, the student will not be able to display the project at a GA-sponsored class “science fair” or “meet & greet.” Any student found plagiarising or attempting to plagiarise will be disciplined accordingly (including but not limited to removal from class)."

### When in Doubt, Talk to Us!

Often times you will have to make a judgement call, and we want to help you make the correct one.  Please keep in mind, our goal is not to scare you, to investigate your every move or try to remove you from the program, but instead prepare you for the real world. We are on your team. We want you to do well in the program and get hired at a job you love. We are not trying to scare you about the pitfalls that you may encounter, but instead prepare you for a career working with intellectual property, of your own creation and that of the larger software community.

Looking up someone else's solution to a problem might not be in the spirit of an assignment. The point of an assignment is often to get you to think about your own solution -- to learn by attempting. So while looking at someone else's solution might not be plagiarism, it still potentially undermines your learning. Even though Googling effectively to find similar problems and their solutions is an immensely helpful skill as a software developer, the ultimate goal for you in this bootcamp is to learn _how_ to do something, not just how to find the correct answer.

Whenever you are in doubt about using someone else's code, or how to go about doing so, please ask a consultant for advice. It never hurts to ask questions, permission, or to be overly transparent.

### Attribution

Read the following writeup on attribution when dealing with code snippets: [Attribution](https://mogsdad.wordpress.com/2015/08/11/did-you-know-its-worthwhile-including-attribution-for-code-snippets/)

#### What does Attribution mean?

In your own words, define what attribution is, and how it relates to software development, and using other people's code

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
```

#### When is attribution necessary?

When should you use attribution when writing software?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
```

## Licensing and Open Source

Just because code is public does not mean it is Open Source. And just because something is called Open Source, does not mean you are free to do whatever you want with that code. Read [This Open Source Legal Guide](https://opensource.guide/legal/) and answer the following questions.

What is the MIT license?

What is the GPL license?

What is the Creative Commons License?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
```


## Research the following

How do you obtain copyrighted work?

What is intellectual property?

What is considered common knowledge, that cannot be copyrighted?
 
Is a Question and Answer site like Stack Overflow sharing knowledge or original bodies of work?

Can you copy an algorithm? 

Can you copyright an algorithm?

```md
<!-- your answers here -->
```


#### Scenario 1:

You are working on making a dice game, and query Stack Overflow for a method to roll a 6 sided die and get back a random number. The code uses a mix of JavaScript, code comments, and explanations on how to use the code.

If you used the previous code snippet, should you include attribution? How do you "cite sources" in code?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
```


#### Scenario 2:

You are working on your tic-tac-toe project, and are stuck on the "game engine", the core of the logic that allows the rules of the game to work as expected. You are sent a link to a GA alumni's repository, and are tempted to take a look at how they solved the challenge. 

You are puzzled as to the choice to look at another student's code, and use some of the ideas in your own source code. Think about the following:

- Should I look at the code? Why or why not?
- Am I safe to include some of the code? Why or why not?
- Am I safe to include All of the code? Why or why not?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
```


#### Scenario 3

Working through exercises and examples in the class Ruby Objects for Beginners book, you see an example where the author solves the MBTA challenge, finding the intersection between different subway stops, and calculating the number of stops. As it turns out, your instructors assign the exact same problem.

You debate how to go about turning in your solution, as you already worked through the example in the book, copying basically word-for-word the solution.

- Are you safe to use the solution in the book?
- Should you include any attribution?
- Is the information in the book protected in any way?
- What happens if you later decide to write a blog post and publish it on your website, detailing the same problem. What precautions should you take?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
```


#### Scenario 4: 

Is there a difference between copying from a tic-tac-toe tutorial vs a previous student's tic-tac-toe project? What about an object-oriented programming tutorial for your own learning?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
```

### Legal Concerns

It never hurts to state the obvious: I (we) are not lawyers, and nothing in this study constitutes legal advice.
