'My home IP address is: 127.0.0.1. So is yours. Guess now I know where you live. Google has many IP addresses. Like 216.239.32.0 or 66.102.15.255. Now you know where Google lives.

But, my home IP address isn\'t my public IP address, that is 203.15.20.74.
Some IP addresses like 893.239.2939.2 would be invalid.
IP addresses from MIT start with an 18 like 18.221.23.4. Another one would be
18.238.10.38. Is 18.238.10.3800 one? No. How about 174.443.1222.12, is that valid? No.

My phone number is 617-555-1212, which you could also write as 1-617-555-1212.
The phone number of my best friend when I was a kid was 2122948438. I sometimes buy music gear from 800-222-4700.
I\'ve tried to call the number 100-100-1111 but I think its invalid since the
phone system doesn\'t work when I call it. If you feel like having some Chipotle,
you could call 857-244-6579.

My email address is tbone@gmail.com but email addresses are hard to validate
with regex. You can try, or you could just use a gem. bob@example.com is an example address. So is jessica@hotmail.com.
And heather@optimumonline.net, but you probably should use a different email provider, Heather.

My zip code is 02135 which is Brighton. I used to live in 10021, back in the good ol\' days.
In the US 039482 would be an invalid zip code. As is 021111.

I love the color #ccddee but I really don\'t like the color #b1dafb or #5r3edd.
I once painted a room #741d0d...I tried to paint a room #y729iu but that isn\'t a color.
