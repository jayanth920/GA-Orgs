# Ruby Regex Lab

Regex (regular expressions) are a special datatype in Ruby that allows you to declare a pattern that can be used to match other objects like strings. This is an example of declarative programming that we talked about earlier in the week, because you're just specifying the *results* that you'd like to see, not telling the computer how to do it.

- Use `@source_text` as your data source for extracting data. Do not edit this file.

  - (format for valid IP address is xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)
- Extract all *valid* IP addresses from MIT into an array returning from the `valid_mit_ip_addresses` method
  - (format 18.xxx.xxx.xxx)
- From this data, create an array of non-MIT IP addresses from the `non_mit_ip_addresses` method
- Extract unique valid US phone numbers into an array returning from the `valid_phone_numbers` method
