# Building A  Full-Stack Application

This second project will be your first foray into building a full-stack
application. You'll be building your first real back-end app, with a
front-end to match, which means you'll learn about what it takes to build an
API and use it.

At a high level, here are our goals for you in this project:

-   Build a single-page application (SPA) with basic user authentication (sign up, sign in, sign out, change password) that
    interacts with a custom API that you build
-   Build an app that can create, read, update, and delete data in a
    database
-   Learn to create user stories and wireframes (before writing code) as part of
    planning out your app.
-   Learn to confidently present your work to a technical audience (5-10 minute
    presentation)

You will be working individually for this project, and you'll be designing the
app yourself. Remember to keep things small – scope creep/feature creep is a
huge potential pitfall for any project!
