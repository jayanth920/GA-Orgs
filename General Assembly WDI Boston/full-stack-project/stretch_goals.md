# Stretch Goals

Once (and only once) you've satisfied the core requirements, here are some
additional goals that you can shoot for:

-   Incorporate Bootstrap or some other front-end tool.
-   Interact with third-party APIs and integrate them into your app.
-   Put some extra thought and effort into visual and UI design.
