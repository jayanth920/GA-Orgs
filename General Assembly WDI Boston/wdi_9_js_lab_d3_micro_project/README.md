# D3 Micro Project

Use D3 to retrieve a JSON data set from somewhere on the internet and create an interesting visualization for it. Make this interactive in some way: Clicking an element, submitting a form, or changing a dropdown should filter the data and update the visualization. For an extra challenge, use transitions to jazz up your interactions!

Open data sources using the **[SODA standard](http://dev.socrata.com/)** work well for this assignment, since they don't need API keys or any other special setup, and can be filtered using a set of common [query parameters](http://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries.html). The City of Boston makes [a number of datasets](https://data.cityofboston.gov/browse?limitTo=datasets) available using SODA, and there are [many other possibilities](https://opendata.socrata.com/dataset/Socrata-Customer-Spotlights/6wk3-4ija).
