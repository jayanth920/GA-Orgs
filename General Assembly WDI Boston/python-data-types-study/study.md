# Python Data Types Study

Python is a whole new world compared to JavaScript, and we need to get our
bearings. The basis behind any programming language is it's data types, so we'll
be digging deeper into Python's built-in data types using the official Python
documentation.

## Documentation-Hunt

When you go digging, you find treasure! So grab a shovel (and your favorite browser) and let's go digging through the docs!

### Quotes Mark the Spot

Ah, strings! We know them, we love them. Truly our favorite kind of ordered
characters wrapped in quotes, there's nothing quite like a good string.

We're in Python Land, and the locals call this place "`str` Island" after the
Python class `str`.

Here are a few maps of the area:

- https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods

### Counting Gold

What would we do without numbers? Just guess how much money we have? What a world that would be if we never knew how to count our coins!

We've caught sight of "Numeral Shore" off in the distance! They say the sands
on this island multiply as you start to count them - pirates like yourself have
been burried alive in their attempts to count them all.

Break out your maps! Time to get hunting.

### Fountain of Truth (or False)

Booleans are the true (or false) MVPs of coding languages. They manage to do so
much with two simple values. Python's `True` and `False` look like the
taller, potentially more grown-up siblings of JavaScript's `true` and `false`, but they still act the same.

Let's get to exploring the power of Booleans by visiting the Fountain of Truth or False.
