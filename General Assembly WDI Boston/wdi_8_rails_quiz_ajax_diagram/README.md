# Rails Ajax Quiz

This is not your standard quiz. Don't worry about forking or pull requests. Instead, find a sheet of paper and writing tool. 

Understanding the flow of requests and data is highly important for being able to do AJAX with Rails effectively. 

Below is a description of a *very basic* Rails site using AJAX. Your task is to diagram the flow, order and details of the HTTP requests, the controllers & actions they will go to, and the views that will be rendered for a specific user story.

**Do not use the internet, your notes, or any other resource for reference**

Give as much detail as possible. Assume that the model is called Comment and there is a CommentsController. There are no tricks here. You will be evaluated on accuracy and demonstration of understanding of this topic. 

## User Story

A user browses to http://example-ajax-site.com/comments which contains a list of comments that are retrieved via AJAX from the Rails server. There is a form at the top of the page to submit a new comment via AJAX, which should then appear on the page after the server has validated it without reloading. The user uses this form to submit a new comment on the page and their comment appears on the page.
