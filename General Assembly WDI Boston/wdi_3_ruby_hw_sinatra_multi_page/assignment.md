## Movies 2 Lab (4:30 - 5:30)

**Objectives:**

* Practice creating a multi-page app with Sinatra

**Activity:**

* Students will spend the last hour getting started on this project with support from the instructional team.

* Create a Sinatra app using the movies.csv file for storing data.
* Create an index page that links to each individual movie page
* Create pages for each movie- showing title, year of release, director name, an image (url included in csv) and box office revenue
* Create a "new movie" page, which will append information about additional movies to the movies.csv file
* No CSS or Javascript please

movies.csv has movie title, year released, director name, image url and box office revenue on each line in that order. It is comma delimited/separated between each field.
