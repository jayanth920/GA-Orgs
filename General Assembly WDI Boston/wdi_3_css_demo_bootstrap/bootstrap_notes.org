** Examples
*** builtwithbootstrap.com
*** lovebootstrap.com
*** expo.bootstrap.com
  Noticed by developers of bootstrap.
** Mobile first approach.
  Think about design on small devices, phones.
** I.E 8 and higher.
  need some hack to get I.E 8 to work otherwise works on I.E 9 and above.
** No more sprites
  Could not scale up or change color.
** Font icons are vector icons
  Can scale up fonts.
** Competitors, Zurb foundation.
** Is a responsive design framework.
  Somewhere between a canned CMS and a site built from raw CSS.
** Pros
*** Some of the work is already done for you.
*** Still customizable
    Doesn't NEED to look like all the other sites that use bootstrap.

** Cons
*** Code "bloat"
   More code that if this was developed for one app using CSS/HTML/JS.

** Avoid customization in the download.
  Will have to remember all the choices in this version if you have get a more
  recent version.
** Only need the css, fonts and js directories.
*** You will get the minified and plain files.
** CSS
** Fonts
   Series of icons you can use. All vector based, as opposed to raster based.
** Javascript.
*** Need to download jquery and respond.js

** JQuery is required
*** JQuery 1.x will support I.E 8 and above
*** JQuery 2.x will support I.E 9 and above
*** Add jquery to the bottom of the body, the footer.
   This will make sure that the HTML is loaded before the javascript.
   You may have jquery/js code that works on the DOM.
** Add bootstrap.js after jquery
* Add respond.js after bootstrap.js
  Create a respond.js in the js directory.
** Add the respond.js in the head
* Grid
** 12 column grid
** 4 sizes, extra small
*** extra small (col-xs) < 768 pixels
*** small (col-sm) >= 768 pixels
*** medium (col-md) >= 992 pixels
*** large (col-lg) >= 1200px
