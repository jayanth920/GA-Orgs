# Lab: Program Execution

## Objectives

By the end of this exercise a student should be able to:

- Read programs to determine their flow
- Comment programs to document their flow
- Reason about the results that a program will return

## Instructions, Reading

- Fork this exercise on Github, and clone it to your system
- Run `bundle install` to ensure that you have all needed *ruby gems* needed for this program
- Follow along and comment the code in `lib/triangle.rb` and `lib/triangle/valid_triangle.rb`
- (optional) follow along and comment the tests in `spec/valid_triangle_spec.rb`. Try out the tests by running `rspec spec/valid_triangle_spec.rb`

## Instructions, Writing (Your Turn)

- In `lib/is_prime.rb` write a method (we will go more into these soon) that returns true or false if a number is [prime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number).
- Do not use gets or puts.
- Test your results by running `rspec spec/is_prime_spec.rb`
