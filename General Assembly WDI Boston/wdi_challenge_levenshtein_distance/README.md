# Challenge: Levenshtein Distance

Calculating [Levenshtein Distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) is a great problem to practice string manipulation. It is like the Hamming Distance, but works for strings of dissimilar length.

Write a method called `levenshtein_distance` that takes two strings as arguments, and returns the Levenshtein Distance as an integer.

There are tests in the spec folder that you can use to check your work. Run these tests with `rspec spec`. When you're done, make a pull request so that others can compare their solutions against yours.

Attempt to not find Ruby code online that solves this problem (code in other languages as an example is ok). The Wikipedia article will be very helpful.
