## Intro to the Bash terminal

What is a Bash terminal? Bash is a wrapper and a command language that helps us
interact with our terminal. Our terminal is a way we can interact with our
computer.

Normally we interact with our computer through a programs interface. Open your
file explorer application. Note the files you see there.

_Note: New windows don't open to the Home directory by default for Mac users. In
order to find this directory, click on **Go** and then **Home** at the top left
of the computer screen._

### Code Along: Explore the Home Directory

Open your terminal and notice that by default you start in your _Home_
directory. We can inspect the files that are currently in this directory
by using the command `ls` command (mnemonic: "list"). If you compare the
files and directories listed here they will be the same as the ones
in the file explorer application.

So we can see that the terminal is just a new way of interacting with our computer.

### Code Along: User Manuals

There are commands that we can use inside the terminal that allows us to interact
with the terminal. Luckily the terminal comes with a manual that we can use in
order to find out how to use a command.

To use the manual you use the commands `man` followed by the name of the command
you want to know more about. Let's dive into putting this into practice.

Inside of your terminal:

```bash
man rm
```

You should receive the following back:

```bash
NAME
     rm, unlink -- remove directory entries

SYNOPSIS
     rm [-dfiPRrvW] file ...
     unlink file

DESCRIPTION
...
     The options are as follows:
     -d Attempt to remove directories as well as other types of files.
     ...
```

Let's break down each section on this manual page.

_Name_ - The name of the command, followed by a one-line decryption of what
it does.
_Synopsis_ - A formal description of how to run it and what command line
options it takes.
_Description_ - A textual description of the functioning of the command.

If you take a look at the _Synopsis_ it tells us exactly how to use this `rm`
command. Let's use this to craft a command to remove a directory called `removeMe`:

```bash
rm -d removeMe
```

1. Start with the command, `rm`
2. We need to use the option, or flag, `-d` because this is a directory and by default
   the `rm` command only removes files
3. Pass in the directory you want to remove

_Note: In the synopsis section you see `[-dfiPRrvW]` these are commonly called flags.
Each one of these flags descriptions are in the description section of the manual_

### Lab: Cheat Sheet

Let's get familiar with some common commands and create a cheat sheet to use
while we move through this lesson.

Open `cheatSheet.md` and complete each section. We already went over `rm` so
it's already completed for you.

## Exploring the File System

You're probably used to creating files and folders using your operating system's
"explorer" program. The common explorer programs found on each OS are:

- Mac: Finder
- Windows: File Explorer
- Ubuntu: Files

On unix-like systems (sometimes referred to as *nix or POSIX), all your files are
stored in your home folder. On Windows, your files are usually stored in "My
Documents".

You might see `~` or `$HOME` used to refer to your home folder on unix-like
systems.

## Directories and Paths

Directories (and subdirectories) are usually represented as "folders" in your
explorer application. They're just convenient ways of grouping files together.
Paths are string (textual) representations of your current place in the file
hierarchy (or "tree").

Examine this path: `/Users/GA`. The leading slash (`/`) is the root of the
file system. The next part `Users` indicates that there is a directory, or
folder, with the name "Users" inside the root of the file system. Within the
"Users" directory is another directory named `GA`. The string
`/Users/GA` is an absolute path to the home directory for the current user.

### Absolute Paths

An absolute path shows the unique location of the files and directories within
the system's file system. No other files can have this path.

Note: It sometimes helps to think of the path as the actual full name of the
file. This is especially true when we are moving or renaming files from the
command line.

Absolute paths:

- Always start with a leading slash, '/'
- Are relative to the root directory of the file system.

The root directory is the top level directory in the tree structure that makes up
your project or file system. When we talk about absolute paths, the paths are
relative to the topmost path of the file system.

### Code Along: Explore the Root Path

In your terminal sessions, figure out what directory you are in by using the
`pwd` command (mnemonic: "print working directory"). What is the topmost
directory in this path? What is the root of the file system?

Open up the Finder and go to the root directory of your filesystem. There are
several ways to accomplish this, one is using the `⌘ + ⇧ + g` shortcut in
Finder, typing in `/`, and clicking `Go`. Examine the contents of the root
directory.

Now, back in your terminal, change your current working directory to the root
of the file system using the `cd` command (mnemonic: "change directory"). What
happens if we type `cd` and then press the "Return" or "Enter" key? Let's wait
before we answer that question.

In order to change to the root directory, we type `cd /`. In this case, we're
giving the `cd` command an absolute path. How do we know it's an absolute path?
Confirm you're in the root directory by using the `pwd` command.

In order to get back to your home directory, you can type `cd ~`, or `cd $HOME`,
or even just `cd`. Try it!

### Relative Paths

Relative paths are paths described with respect to the current working
directory. What command do we use to figure out our current working directory?

So if I'm in my home directory and I see a folder `projects` (how would I see
that?), I can guess the full path to `projects` is `/Users/GA/projects`.
However, since I'm already in the home folder, the `ls` command tells me only
unique part of the name needed to distinguish it from sibling directories.
Sibling directories are directories that exist "beside" other directories,
instead of within them ("child directories") or above them ("parent
directories").

This "partial path" is a relative path. It's pretty useful, since I can use it
to change into the directory by using `cd projects`. So, in addition to taking
absolute paths, `cd` can take relative paths to navigate the file system. Neat!

There are two special relative directories.

- `..` represents the parent directory.
- `.` represents the current directory.

So, in order to navigate to a grandparent (parent of a parent) directory from
the current directory, what command would we use?

### Tab Complete

Files paths can be very long, and typing them by hand is time consuming and
error-prone. Fortunately, your terminal has a feature called tab completion that
fills in file and directory names for you. It behaves a bit like autocorrect on
a smartphone, except that you have to hit the tab key to make it happen.

Tab complete can be used with both relative and absolute paths. If I have a file
called `a-very-very-long-filename.txt` in my current working directory, I can
type `a-v` (the first few letters of the filename) and hit tab, and it will
complete the filename for me.

Let's say I want to type the absolute path to that file, which is
`/Users/GA/trainings/a-very-very-long-filename.txt`. I can do that very quickly
with tab complete! I could type `/U`, then hit tab, then `G` and tab again, then
`t` or `tr` and hit tab, then `a-v` or `a-`, just like above.

Not only is this faster, but it will let you know if the file/directory you're
looking for really exists, preventing lots of common mistakes. If you try to tab
complete a file or directory that doesn't exist, nothing will happen. You should
use tab complete whenever possible!

### Lab: Make a Subdirectory

Now that we're back in the home directory, let's create a place to store all the
work we're going to do in this SEI. Naming can often be difficult, but simple
names are best. Let's create subdirectories inside of the `sei` directory our scripts
created yesterday. Always use lowercase names for your directories and files.

Before issuing the command in the terminal, bring your explorer window into
focus, the one with the home directory open. Resize and position it so that it
is visible along with the terminal. Now, in the terminal `cd` into your `sei` directory.

Create the following directories as well. They should be subdirectories of
`sei`.

- `trainings`
- `diagnostics`
- `projects`
- `tmp`
- `challenges`
- `practices`
- `studies`

Verify that your directory structure resembles the following:

```sh
~/sei
├── challenges
├── diagnostics
├── django-env
├── practices
├── projects
├── studies
├── tmp
└── trainings
```

Now that we have our sei directory setup, use the `mv` command to move some
files into it.

Find where the `unix-cli` and `installfest` directories are
stored (may be in the home directory). Then move those directories into the
`trainings` directory.

## Files

Let's use the `tmp` directory to play around. `tmp` directories are
conventionally used to store files that can be safely deleted. You should never
put anything in them that you want to keep.

### Code Along: Create/Edit a File

Move into the `tmp` directory inside `sei`. Create a new file using the `touch`
command. Let's make a blank text file: `touch name.txt`.

Next open that file in vscode: `code name.txt`. Write your name inside this file
and save it. On a Mac, the shortcut to save a file is `⌘ + s`, or`ctrl + s` on
Linux. You can also search for the save command (indeed, any command) using the
command palette. Try it by bringing up the palette with
`⌘ + ⇧ + p` (`ctrl + shift + p` on Linux). Then search for "Save".

Lets quickly take a peek inside the file we just created in our terminal.
Type `cat name.txt`.

Now type `open name.txt` (`xdg-open name.txt` on Linux).

See what happened? The file `name.txt` opens in whatever default application
your computer uses for that type of file.

Let's say that we didn't mean to call the file `name.txt`, how would we go about
editing the file name to correct it?

### Lab: Copying a Hidden File

Hidden files in your file system are denoted by a leading `.`. You can see these
files using the command `ls -a`.
Create a hidden file `.env`.
Copy this file using the command `cp <original_name> <new_name>` to a new file
named `.newEnv`.
Check your work by typing `ls -a`.

### Code Along: Deleting a File

How do we get rid of this file? We'll use the `rm` command. But first: a
warning. This is a very dangerous command. Do not ever press enter after typing
`rm` without being **certain** you're targeting the right file. There's no way
to recover files deleted with `rm`. The same advice goes double with flags
like `-r` or other flags. Flags are options that occur after dashes when
issuing commands.

```sh
rm -r <file_or_directory> # Will delete all files inside a folder as well as folder
```

### Lab: Delete a File

Read the manual entry for `rm`. When you're done reading, you can quit by
pressing `q`. Delete the `name.txt` file you created in the previous exercise.
Type the command, then check with a colleague before pressing issuing the
command.

### Important Note: Closing Your Terminal

You shouldn't close your terminal by clicking the "X" button. This can leave
processes from that terminal session running in the background which can cause
problems in the future. Instead, you should use a keyboard shortcut to safely
and completely end the terminal session.

On **macOS** you should first press `CTRL + D` in any tabs that are running
continuous processes like servers, then press `CMD + Q`.

On **Ubuntu** you should use `CTRL + D`. Note that this only is only possible
when no process is running in the terminal -- you can end almost any process and
clear any entered text with `CTRL + C`.
