# Spiral Path

Write a function called "spiral" that takes an NxM array as input and returns a "spiral" path through the array, starting in the upper-left corner and moving clockwise.  Use the  language of your choice.

For example (in Ruby), if

```ruby
array = [[1,2,3],
         [8,9,4],
         [7,6,5]]
```

then

```ruby
spiral(array) # => [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
```

It should work on any NxM array, so don't assume the input is a square array.  However, every row will have the same number of elements.
