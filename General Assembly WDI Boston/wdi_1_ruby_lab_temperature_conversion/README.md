# Lab: Temperature Conversion

## Objectives

By the end of this exercise a student should be able to:

- Run RSpec tests
- Write functions to fulfil those tests
- Calculate results using math methods

## Instructions

- Run `bundle install` to ensure that you have all needed *ruby gems* needed for this program
- Run `rspec spec/temperature_conversion_spec` to run the tests
- In Sublime modify the `lib/temperature_conversion.rb` file to make one test pass.
- Make a Git commit when a test passes.
- Repeat the process of running tests, modifying `lib/temperature_conversion.rb`, re-rerunning tests, and making Git commits until all 6 tests pass.
- Push your code to Github (`git push origin master`)
- Make a Pull Request to turn in your work

## Bonus 1

Calculate fibbonaci numbers by running the fib test.

## Bonus 2

If you have completed the temperature conversion and would like a challenge, run the the specs for the Roman Numeral Convertor (`rspec spec/roman_numeral_spec`) and modify the code in `lib/roman_numeral.rb` to make the tests pass.

This is significantly more difficult, and you may encounter difficulties.
