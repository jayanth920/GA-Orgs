### Curl single book demonstration

We'll use curl to add a book. Watch as I add a script to my `scripts/books/post.sh` file
and run it in my terminal.

### Curl single book code along

We'll use curl to add a book. Code along as I add a script to my `scripts/books/post.sh`
file and run it in my terminal.

### Curl single book lab

Now write your own curl script in `scripts/books/post.sh`.  Add a few books.

### AJAX single book demo and lab

Watch as I change the code in `index.html` and alter the javascript.

We'll be going back and forth between watching me and doing it yourself.
