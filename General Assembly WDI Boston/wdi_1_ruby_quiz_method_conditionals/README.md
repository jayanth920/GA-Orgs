# Quiz 2
## Methods and Conditionals

### Tasks

1. Create a method called `square` which takes a parameter `x` and squares it

2.  Create a method called `to_bool`, which takes a string parameter called `questionable_string` and if the text of the string is 'true' then return the boolean value true, otherwise return false. 

3. Create a method called `is_prime`, which calculates if an input parameter `x` is prime, and return true or false. Just brute force this and don't try to be too smart about it.
