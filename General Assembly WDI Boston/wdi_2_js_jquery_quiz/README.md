# Quiz: An Introduction to jQuery

#### Directions

* Fork and clone this quiz.

* Modify the code under the exercise/ directory as follows:

  - When the user clicks either conversion button, you should perform the appropriate calculation and update any form fields that need updating.  The temperature conversion formulas are provided in the Javascript file.

  - When you do the conversion, you should set the background color of the page to reflect how warm or cold the temperature is.  Use purple for temperatures below freezing, blue for temperatures between 0 C and 10 C, yellow for temperatures between 10 C and 20 C, orange for temperatures between 20 C and 30 C, and red for temperatures above 30 C.

* You have 30 minutes. When you're done, commit your work and make a
  pull request.

* Feel free to use your notes and Google, but you should work by
  yourself (not with a partner).

* Remember that you can also use jshint to check the correctness and
  style of your code.
