# Unit 1 Project

## Overview

We will put Java knowledge to use! Create a basic version of Rock-Paper-Scissors that allows users to play against the computer in the console. The game consists of a few main features:

- Play Rock Paper Scissors against a computer player
- Play Rock Paper Scissors against a human player

> Hint: Use a random [number generator](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Random.html) to pick the computer's choice.

## Feature Requirements

Your game must:

- Have a main menu with options to enter "2 players" or "vs. Computer":
- If the user enters "2 players", they should be able to play Rock Paper Scissors against a human competitor
- If the user enters "vs. Computer", they should be able to play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer
- When the game is over, the winner should be declared

## Technical Requirements
- Use Classes to remove repetitive parts of code and abstract out a “Player” class used to manage the state of the player (if they have won or loss), how many points they have, what move they have made
- Handle invalid user input
- Handle incorrect capitalization of otherwise valid user input (rock, Rock, RoCk, ROCK, etc.)
- Each Class (including a Player class) should have methods associated with it and be instantiated as an object (as opposed to a singleton or a interface)
- Use `public`, `private`, and `static` `variables`, `methods` and `members` within each class appropriately. 
- Incorporate Exception Handling to make sure your game crashes gracefully if it receives bad input.
- Get Standard Input/Output with Java using a `Scanner` or use `Processing` to get mouse / keyboard / x input.
- Use Arrays or ArrayLists to store game history (if applicable)

## Bonus Ideas: 
- Write automated JUnit tests for your application.
- Use an Agile project management framework to architect your game
- If the user enters "history", the program should display previous game history (winner's name, game date, etc.)
- Use Java `packages` to modularize code. Place any “helper” tools in these packages, they could be related input, networking, or graphics.
- Use Maven / Grade to install external dependencies that your game might require.
- Use [Generics](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/generics/index.html) on Collections such as Arrays and ArrayLists to store different data that may compose of different types
- Do multitasking with multithreading to handle concurrent requests (like in multiplayer games)
- Incorporating Video, Text, Data, Networking, and Sound into your game via Processing

#### Code of Conduct

As always, your app must adhere to General Assembly's [student code of conduct guidelines](../../../resources/guidelines/code-of-conduct.md).

If you have questions about whether or not your work adheres to these guidelines, please speak with a member of your instructional team.

#### Necessary Deliverables

Submit a pull request with a Java program that meets the above requirements.

Below, you can see sample output:

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems
- Read the docs for whatever technologies you use. **Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always. However, learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer!**
- Write pseudocode before you write actual code.

### Useful Resources

- [Random number generator](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Random.html)

#### Project Feedback + Evaluation


Based on the requirements you can earn a maximum of 8 points on this project. Your instructors will score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
