> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

## Exercise

`Processing` is primarily a tool for creative coders and some game developers.
We can leverage it to add `graphics`, `interactivity`, and novel technologies
such as `computer vision`. For this homework you will be required to setup
processing on your own and go through the processing tutorials to learn the
syntax.

More info on processing:
https://processing.org/


#### Requirements

- Setup processing with IntelliJ
- Complete Tutorials given
- Create a simple project that leverages graphics or interactivity features of `Processing`

**Bonus:**
- Add some logic to your `Processing` program / turn it into a game
  - Add a Win / Lose state
  - Keep score
  - High score board
- Use `Objects` and `Classes`

#### Deliverable

**Part I**

The first step is to setup your environment, here are a couple of resources:

- Download Processing and copy it to your `Applications` https://processing.org/
- Create a new **empty** project with `IntelliJ`.
- Use the instructions below to create an applet.
- http://proto.ink/2016/06/03/processing-in-intellij-combining-proper-java-with-processing/

*note*: if you are having trouble you can use the [Processing IDE](https://processing.org/download/)

**Part II**

Use these as a reference / guide. You will not have to submit the code in
these tutorials.

https://processing.org/tutorials/interactivity/

https://processing.org/tutorials/color/

https://processing.org/tutorials/objects/

https://processing.org/tutorials/arrays/

**Part III**

Create a game /visualization that leverages the interactivity and graphics. For
example here is a simple traffic simulator created with Processing:

Game requirements:
- User input ( mouse / keyboard ) 
- Some way to keep track of a score
- a win and a lose state
- a way to reset to state to the beginning
