# Subclasses with Animals Lab

## Introduction

In this lab you will be using your knowledge of classes to build an Animal class, complete with properties, getters and setters. After completing the class, you will then create subclasses of Animal called Mammal and Reptile. Finally, you will create at least one subclass of Mammal, and one subclass of Reptile, making them whatever animals you want.

Each subclass should have some unique property that differentiates it from its parent class. For instance, a reptile could have a boolean to determine if it has a shell, or a snake could have a boolean to determine if it is poisonous.

You will create an app that allows the user to create these subclasses of Mammal and Reptile (the user gives some sort of input to customize it, such as setting whether a snake is poisonous). Show the created animals in a ListView.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Create an Animal class with the following properties set in the constructor: mNumLegs, mTopSpeed, mIsEndangered, mName.
- Create subclasses of Animal called Mammal and Reptile
- Create at least one subclass of Mammal, and one subclass of Reptile
- Each subclass must have something that makes it unique from its parent class.
- Create an app that allows the user to add each of your unique animals.

**Bonus:**
- Create more than the minimum number of mammal or reptile subclasses
- When the user selects an animal it takes them to a details output for the animal, showing all of its properties


#### Starter code

There is no starter code for this lab.

#### Deliverable

An app that meets the requirements above.
