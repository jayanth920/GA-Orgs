## OPENING 5 mins

**Hook:** Earlier in the course, we talked a lot about validating ideas and what goes into an MVP. But what happens after a product idea has been validated? Today, we’re going to explore a few processes by which products get developed. Let’s start with an exercise.

<br>

## ACTIVITY: THE DESIGN CHALLENGE  20 mins

- Break into groups of four to six.
- Designate one person the product owner.
- Designate one person the Scrum Master.
- Each team must create paper airplanes. Each person must contribute one fold to each plane. Each plane must fly four feet.
- Give each team roughly 20 sheets of paper.
- Teams get one minute to plan; then have them do a three-minute sprint. The product owner counts how many planes were successful and how many were buggy.
- Write on the board each team’s success rate and bugginess rate.
- Repeat the sprint three times.

Instructor Notes:

- Teams should have improved metrics by the third sprint.
- Teams should do better testing each plane as it’s complete — this gives them time to fix any buggy planes.

<br>

## INTRODUCTION: THE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS 10 mins

> Instructor Notes: Walk through four models for building digital products, comparing and contrasting each while creating a list of pros and cons. Each model should take no more than five minutes. Students read about Agile development in pre-work, so they should have a baseline.

**Agile and Lean** have evolved as ways to reach Product-Market Fit faster. We are going to explore the four commonly accepted product methodologies to get a better sense of each. We’ll introduce these briefly, then do an exercise to dig a bit deeper.

**Waterfall** is “the way things have always been.” It’s a sequential process wherein each stage of development is completed before moving onto the next stage, like a waterfall progressing down a series of steps or tiers. It typically involves a requirements-gathering process followed by design, development, delivery, etc.

On the other hand, you have Agile. In its simplest form, Agile is an iterative process of development. In Agile methods, instead of building the whole product, you build the smallest possible useful part and give it to users, who tell you what is right and what is wrong.

**Waterfall — Sequential**

- Waterfall was originally a method for building shrink-wrapped software that could only launch once. Now, with the ability to send updates over the web, that constraint is lifted.

- Times when Waterfall may still be used:
    - Hardware, or when you need to launch a version of your product and need to manufacture at scale.

**Agile — Iterative**

- Agile methodology is a project management approach that takes into account unpredictability, because its basic tools are designed to incorporate flexibility into development.

**Hybrid — Sequential Upfront + Iterative Development**

- A hybrid approach will involve sequential or Waterfall processes in the beginning, followed by Agile or iterative development.  

**Lean — Focus on MVP and Product-Market Fit**

- The Lean process focuses on creating a minimum viable product and ensuring that there is a Product-Market Fit. There are many more principles to the Lean process of creating minimum viable features or products (which were covered in week 3).
- Lean tells you to optimize the end-to-end process, from the initial idea to collecting revenues. This ultimately creates value for your customer. Lean principles focus on flow more than anything else; bottlenecks must be removed.
- Lean is a type of Agile process, just like Kanban and Scrum.

Most teams are somewhere in the middle of Agile and Waterfall, embracing some Agile practices while utilizing some Waterfall ones. It’s hard to find teams that are strictly at one end or the other.

Check:

Which groups from our first activity were Agile? Which were Waterfall?
What are some reasons an organization might choose a “Hybrid” approach to development rather than being fully Agile or fully Waterfall?

## INTRO TO NEW MATERIAL: AGILE  15 mins

Where and when did Agile methodology begin?

On February 11-13, 2001, at The Lodge at Snowbird ski resort in the Wasatch mountains of Utah, seventeen people met to talk, ski, relax, and find common ground. What emerged was the Agile Manifesto for Software Development. The manifesto was created out of the need for an alternative to documentation-driven, heavyweight software development processes.

The Agile Manifesto has four principles:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.

Let’s cover each one in more detail.

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools:

    - You can solve problems faster and better with communication instead of checklists.

- Working software over comprehensive documentation:

    - In Waterfall, your project isn’t done until you complete all of the requirements as listed in the projects documentation. With Agile, the amount of “Done” increases with every step along the way. It doesn't leap from 0% to 100% solely because the last stage is complete... and no one will miss the documentation.

- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

    - When you throw requirements over the wall (i.e., when you tell your team what to do and how to do it), you create an adversarial relationship with your customers. Instead, partner with your customers throughout the project. Embrace learning and responding to their changing needs.

- Responding to change over following a plan

    - Embrace change. The Agile method is organized to allow teams to respond rapidly when changes occur. With Waterfall, you can’t adapt if there are better opportunities that emerge during the project. For example, let’s say you’re developing a mobile phone when a better CPU hits the market... and you can’t adjust your plans to accommodate. Not changing can also increase costs, because you put so much effort into building the wrong thing, you have to rebuild it after the wrong thing has already shipped.

Check: Turn and Talk: Based on these four principles, why might Agile be considered a “scary” thing for companies to adopt? Share out.

Agile comes with twelve key values. We are going to talk about a few that are key to understanding the method:

- “Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.”
- “Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.”
- “Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to a shorter timescale.”
- “Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.”

Some companies and teams aren’t 100% bought into Agile.

- Many organizations value documentation and requirements, and insist on extensive documentation to make sure everything is in sync.  
- Tend to do the easier Agile things such as standups (which we’ll get to) but not the hard ones like getting your organization to understand that they have to make tradeoffs.
- Teams often take up Agile after disastrous project management messes up a project. “Agile” gets used as an empty buzzword that will solve every development challenge.  
- Many engineers dislike Agile because they think it’s overrated, or because they were in an “Agile team” but didn’t perceive any benefit to their own work. It’s less about the day-to-day of programmers and more about how engineering works in an organization.

<br>

## AGILE DISCUSSION 10mins

- Assign groups of 2-3 students to one of the 12 Agile values.  
- The scenario: Students are product managers at a company that has not bought into the Agile process. Think about how you would explain the value of that Agile principle to stakeholders at the company who are skeptical or hesitant to embrace Agile.
- Each group shares out their takeaways.

<br>

## AGILE ROLES 5mins

There are three main roles in Agile.

- Product Owner:

    - Usually a product manager, but can be a technical owner if the Scrum team is very technical.

- Scrum Master:

    - Replaces the role of project manager. Mostly focused on helping the team be more efficient, interface with other teams, etc. Not focused on timelines.

- Team:

    - This is usually developers, but also anyone whose work will contribute to the sprint. Sometimes design is included in the Scrum team, although usually their work is tracked elsewhere, such as through Trello or Asana. It’s difficult to balance design as part of the sprint; usually you want stories completed, with designs, before entering the sprint.

<br>

## INTRO TO NEW MATERIAL: SCRUM AND SPRINT CYCLES 15 mins

Agile uses the term “rituals” to describe what we would call meetings.

There are four official rituals of Agile: Sprint Planning, Daily Standup, Sprint Review, and Retrospective. However, the community around Agile is considering adding a fifth: Storytime, which is also called Backlog grooming. Either way, holding this meeting is highly encouraged.

- The **Backlog:** This is a list of User Stories, bugs, and other work in priority order. The order is determined by the product management team.

- **Sprints:** A two- to four-week span that includes committing to what will be built, getting work done, demoing the product, and reflecting on how it went.
- In Agile development (depending on the methodology used), team members are assigned roles to manage the sprint process:

    - Product Owner: Holds the vision for the product.
    - Scrum Master: Helps the team best use Scrum* to build the product (like a D&D dungeon master).
    - Development team: They build the product.

- During a sprint, every day features **Standup Meetings**.

    - Why? Communication, transparency, and helping each other out.  
    - These meetings are at the same time and location every day, even if people are missing. The idea is to get into the routine. There are 15 minutes max for the whole development team to cover everything.  
    - The format: What did you do yesterday, what are you doing today, and are you blocked by anything (i.e., do you have any questions). There should only be high-level details; discussions can wait until afterwards.

- Planning, reviews, and retrospectives are three ‘check-in’ meetings at regular intervals throughout the sprint.

    - Sprint planning is a meeting where you discuss various User Stories. The team moves items into the sprint from the backlog and assigns story points. During this time, the team makes sure User Stories and tasks are well-defined.
    - During sprint review, the team checks to make sure they are on track. There is also discussion about changing requirements, if necessary.

    - The final meeting is called a sprint retrospective. The team discusses how things went during the sprint. What worked well? What didn’t? What should the team do differently next time?

- **Estimation and story points:**

    - Traditional software teams have given estimates for stories in a time format (days, weeks, months).  

    - Some Agile teams use sizing for estimation: XS, S, M, L, XL. Many Agile teams have transitioned to story points. Story points rate the relative effort of the work. Today we’ll use sizing for estimation.  

    - Teams use story points because it pushes members to make tougher decisions around the difficulty of the work. Asking questions such as, “How difficult is this work,” instead of, “When can this work be done” changes the conversation.

    - Why use story points?

        - Dates don’t account for the non-project-related work that inevitably creeps into our days: emails, meetings, interviews, etc.

        - Each team will estimate work on a slightly different scale, which means their velocity (measured in points) will be different.  

In short, Agile development is a set of values about communication, working software, collaboration, and responding to change. Agile values are embodied in processes such as Scrum and Kanban. Most organizations runs their teams using a combination of Agile and not-so-Agile methods.

> Instructor Note: Feel free to bring in examples from your own experience. To allow these topics to sink in, an overview of a process that the instructor has gone through or implemented is helpful for students.

<br>

## ACTIVITY: SPRINT PLANNING  15 mins

Break into groups of 4-5 (depending on class size).  Assign roles to each team member:

- Product Owner
- Scrum Master
- Engineer x2

You are renovating a room in your home: the kitchen.

1. As a group, identify some of the things you want in the new kitchen. For each item requested, write it down on an index card.
1. The engineers should estimate each item. For this example, we will use “T-shirt sizes”: XS, S, M, L, XL.  
Instructor Note: Give an example and give it a size. For example: Walk-in pantry might be an L (because you need to plan, shelve, add a door, add flooring, etc.) Marble floor tiles might be an M (because you only have to install them).
1. The product owner is then responsible for prioritizing the requests. The most important should be at the top of the list, followed by those that are less important. This is your “product backlog.” Depending on the length of the list, the product owner needs to prioritize the first 10 items. This is a refined product backlog.  
1. Next, we’ll go into sprint planning. Take the top-priority items from the backlog; the Scrum Master will need to ask what is needed for the first story. The team should ask questions. If the team thinks they can finish the story within two weeks, then add it to the sprint. Continue to do this for the next few stories. Once the team agrees that they are at max capacity (i.e., they’ve agreed to all of the work they can do in a two-week timeframe), confirm the commitment and get ready to begin sprint 1.  

Debrief:
- How was the estimation process? What types of questions did you ask to get better estimates?
- How did the team prioritize? What was important to the product owner? What trade-offs had to be made?
- What kinds of questions did the team ask in order to accurately plan the work? How did you reduce risk around the estimation process?

## CONCLUSION 10 mins

Agile visionaries believed that teamwork is essential to delivering great software, and that great Agile teams embody "we" rather than “I." Nothing is more rewarding than sharing the adventure of building something that truly matters with engaged teammates.

Despite sharing common values, there is no formula for the perfect Agile team. Some implement Scrum, while others use Kanban. We’ve talked a lot about the Scrum-Agile methodology, which is most common for development teams. Either Agile process can make the team deliver faster and have more fun. The job of the product manager in relation to Agile methodologies is to provide the right level of detail to help the team eliminate risk when estimating and ultimately developing products.  

Today we talked through several development methodologies: Waterfall, Agile, Hybrid and Lean. Most companies are doing something in the Hybrid format. The PM should aim to help the team in several ways:


- Include a member of the development team in the customer interview process so they can hear directly from the customer, instead of relying on the PM.
- Create personas together.
- Make backlog grooming a team sport: get everyone on the same page and understand why something is more important than another.

We’ve covered:

- The different stages and roles of Scrum and a sprint cycle.
- Best practices of Agile project management.
- The pros and cons of Agile development.

Preparation is important, and Agile methodologies help the team become more predictable and focused on reducing risk. We’ve covered the methodologies; now we need to connect the dots. The PM is responsible for translating the customer need to the development team in order to build out the best product for the users. The next time we meet, we’ll talk about user stories and various tools used in conjunction with Agile methodologies.
