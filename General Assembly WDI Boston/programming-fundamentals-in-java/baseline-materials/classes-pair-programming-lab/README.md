## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This is a pair programming activity_

In this lab you will be using your knowledge of classes to build an app that utilizes an Animal class, complete with properties, getters and setters. After completing the class, you will instantiate your Animal and use the getters and setters to display it's properties.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Create an Animal class with the following properties: numLegs, topSpeed, isEndangered, name
- Complete the constructor for the Animal class
- Create all getters and setters for the Animal  properties
- Instantiate an Animal  and display some of its properties.
- Use the setter methods to modify some of the animal's properties and show the modified animal.

**Bonus:**
- Add additional methods to your Animal class that return a formatted String using the class properties.

#### Starter code

You will need to complete the constructor, getters and setters in the provided Animal.java file. Main.java contains comments guiding you on the code you need to write.

#### Deliverable

Make your app look like below, following the requirements above.

```
The Elephant has a top speed of 25 mph
The Lion has a top speed of 50 mph
```


#### Test your code


* Test if your text views have proper text in them
* Tests if your Animal constructor works correctly with proper parameters
* Tests Animal classes getters
* Tests Animal classes setters
