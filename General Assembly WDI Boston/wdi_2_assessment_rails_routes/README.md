# Assessment: Rails Routes

## Objectives

In this assessment, students are asked to demonstrate knowledge of:

- Creating resourceful routes that map to controller actions

## Instructions

Fork and clone this repo. Then run the following commands prior to starting to code:

- `cd wdi_2_assessment_rails_routes`
- `bundle install && rake db:create db:migrate db:test:prepare`

Run your tests with `rspec spec`. Write code to make them pass. In this exercise, you *only* need to write code in `config/routes.rb`.

Make a git commit, push your code to Github, and make a Pull Request to turn in your work.
