## Intro to Java

### Java vs. Ruby

- Java is a multipurpose language used for desktop, web, mobile, etc.
- Ruby is typically used for web applications


- Java is a compiled programming language
  - Java code needs to be compiled into bytecode before it can be executed
- Ruby is an interpreted scripting language
  - You can run the code as it's written


- Java is a statically typed language
  - Types and return values must be defined up front and are harder to change
- Ruby is a dynamically typed language
  - Types and return values can change any any time


### Data Types

Primitives (these are not objects)

- integer
  - byte
  - short
  - int
  - long
- float
  - double
  - float
- character
- boolean

The rest are reference types (based on a class rather than a primitive type), also note the upper vs. lower case convention

- String
- Array
- Car
