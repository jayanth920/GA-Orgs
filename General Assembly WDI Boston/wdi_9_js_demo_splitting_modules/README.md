# Javascript - Splitting Modules Across Files

## Objectives

By the end of this, students should be able to:

- Use modules to split javascript code across multiple files.
- Share data among the split module files.

## Instructions

- Inspect all the files in the `app/js` folder.
- Read and attempt to trace each line of code. Discuss with a partner.
- Answer the following questions:
  1. What advantage is there to splitting a module among multiple files?
  1. What advantage is there to storing common data in one file and calling it elsewhere?
  1. Compare the `users` and `module` variables. What do they point to? Where can they be used?
  1. How can we "hide" data or methods using this pattern?
  1. Are private methods or data in one file available to another file?
  1. What is the correlation between the number of files and the number of scopes we create?
