# JS Array Iteration Methods Practice

Practice JS Array Iteration Methods. In this exercise you will practice iterating through
arrays. You will have the opportunity to solve problems using different array iteration methods.

## Prerequisites

- [js-array-iteration-methods](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/js-array-iteration-methods)

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

- Iterate over array's using array iteration methods.
- Create functions to be used as callbacks with an array iteration method.

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.
1. Install any dependencies with `npm install`.
1. Create and checkout a new branch, named `response`.
1. Follow the directions given in [`lib/practice.js`](lib/practice.js).
1. When finished, push to your fork and submit a pull request.

Your pull request description should contain a "fist to five" for comfort and
clarity. Additionally, you should mention the resources you used to help you
complete this diagnostic. For example:

```md
Comfort: 3
Clarity: 3

I used Google and my class notes to help with this exercise.
```

You may wish to refer to [FAQs](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/)
related to [forking,
cloning](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone), and [pull
requests](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/PullRequest).

You may use **any resource** other than each other to complete this exercise.
This includes referencing talk materials, appropriate documentation, and
searching for help online.

You should be running `grunt nag` before diagnosing any bugs, since it finds
some of the most common sources of errors. After `grunt nag` passes, you should
run `grunt test` to run the included tests. Tests will tell you whether of not
your responses are correct.

## Bonus

After completing requirements, there are bonus questions in [`lib/bonus.js`](lib/bonus.js).

To enable these tests open `spec/bonus.spec.js`. Then remove `.skip` as follows.

```js
describe.skip('Bonus:', function () {
```

to

```js
describe('Bonus:', function () {
```
