# D3 Exploration HW

Find a small static dataset that you can put in JSON, CSV, TSV, etc... 

Use D3 to visualize this in an awesome way. Be creative, explore and don't cheat yourself of a good chance to really dig into D3 tonight. 

*Additionally*: Comment your code to show that you really understand what's happening. Write an `explaination.md` file that explains your overall logic. 

Don't use Rails. Don't stress out over animation (as we'll cover that tomorrow) unless you really want to.
