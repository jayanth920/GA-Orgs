- [JavaScript Koans](https://github.com/liammclennan/JavaScript-Koans): I don't love these are much as the Ruby Koans, but they work
- Watch [Douglas Crockford's JavaScript The Good Parts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQVTIJBZook) video. It is approximately one hour, but is massively beneficial to understanding JavaScript.
- [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/): I really really like the challenges presented with this site in Ruby, JS and CoffeeScript
- [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/): I would try doing at least the first 10 of these in JavaScript and Ruby. Use the differences to compare and constrast languages. You already have all the tools you need to do most of these problems in JS.
- [Mozilla MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript): An excellent compendium of everything JavaScript. But its a bit dry and mostly for reference.
- [Idiomatic.js](https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js): A well written style guide for JavaScript
- [Google's JavaScript Style Guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml): Another opinion on style in JS
- [AirBnB's Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript): Yet another opinion of style in JS.
- [Wikipedia on JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript): Provides history, detail and context for the language

### Suggested Additional Books

* [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596517742/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596517742&linkCode=as2&tag=wha07-20) - This book doesn't teach JavaScript. It teaches you what not to do with JavaScript.
* [JavaScript Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596806752/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596806752&linkCode=as2&tag=wha07-20) - Understanding JavaScript's patterns is often difficult. Having a mastery of these will help greatly in this class. This also covers patterns that are undesirable, but which you may find yourself doing. It also further highlights best practices and pitfalls to avoid.
