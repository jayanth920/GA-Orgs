## Create a Simple Rails CRUD app.

This is a "Product" app. It's pretty lite on the what it can do.


Objectives    
* Create a simple controller to show all resources and an individual resource.  
* Introduce routes, controllers, views, actions, params etc.  
* Implement create, update and delete for a resource.  
* Add validations for a resource.  
* Use partials to DRY up views.

See [product_index_show.md](product_index_show.md) and branch simple_controller.

See [product_cud](product_cud.md) and branch add_crud.  


#### Add validations for a resource.

See [product_validations.md](product_validations.md) and branch add_validations.
