# Capstone Modules Guide

For the capstone project, you have the additional option to venture on an
independent study. This study outlines why you might choose this option, and
what to expect if you do.

## Prerequisites

- None

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

- Explain the role "Cloud Developer"
- Explain the role "DevOps Engineer"
- Define the deliverables for the capstone modules options

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.
2. Read and follow the directions outlined below.

## The Big Idea

Want a little less structure? Need a little more challenge? Feel the urge to
learn something totally new all by yourself **and then** make a project?

Introducting: Capstone Modules

----

The capstone modules are myGA modules that provide learning material for a given software engineering focus/specialty. For each module, developers walk
through high-level concepts to gain an understanding of the role on
which that module is based. At the end of the module, developers are expected to apply the new concepts to a final project.

Below is a breakdown of the modules that are currently available.

- [Cloud Developer](https://my.generalassemb.ly/assignments/831c4abf-64eb-4a9a-a49c-3a02489ffca0)
- [DevOps Engineer](https://my.generalassemb.ly/assignments/bd480b8c-9a0b-4c06-96a3-fcf92ec06581)

### Cloud Development

Cloud development refers to the development that goes into managing cloud
processes. This role often involves working with cloud services such as AWS,
either managing and updating those services or integrating new ones into an
application.

Walk through the [Cloud Developer Capstone Project](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/1220?from=dashboard&assignmentUuid=831c4abf-64eb-4a9a-a49c-3a02489ffca0) section of the module to understand what the end project will look like.

### DevOps Engineering

DevOps stands for "development operations" and generally refers to the processes
developers go through to manage actual development. This means there's a large
focus on internal tooling and adding things like continuous integration,
automation, and deployment management.

Walk through the [DevOps Capstone Project](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/1199?from=dashboard&assignmentUuid=bd480b8c-9a0b-4c06-96a3-fcf92ec06581) section of the module to understand what the end project will look like.

## Making the Decision

These modules are designed as independent-studies, which means you will have
_little to no support from the instructional team_. These modules are absolutely
available post-course if the capstone project is not the time for you to take
on this challenge.

If you choose a capstone module you must:

- Bring a backup idea for a project to your pre-project 1:1 discussion
- Have completed all projects on resubmission
- **Be ready! This will be a challenge, and you are not allowed to change the
project half-way through.**
