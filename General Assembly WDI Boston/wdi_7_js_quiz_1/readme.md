# JavaScript Coding Quiz 1

These questions should seem familiar, since we did them in Ruby!

Write the functions for the five questions. You can write any additional code that you need to 'test' the functionality for them as well. Feel free to reference anything in your book, notes or online (except prior student answers) that you need to complete this quiz.
