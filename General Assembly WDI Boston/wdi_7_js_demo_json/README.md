# Demo: JSON

[JSON](http://json.org/) (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.

We use JSON objects to transfer data between applications and Javascript.

- Property names must be double-quoted strings;
- trailing commas are forbidden;
- leading zeroes are prohibited;
- a decimal point must be followed by at least one digit;
- most characters are allowed in strings, except certain control characters;
- strings must be double quoted.
