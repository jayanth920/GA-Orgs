## Honest Tom's Used Cars.

This is a an in class exercise that you should perform in teams. You will be given a scenario where you will be working with a client, Tom, to create an application for his used car lot. 

The below details of what Tom is looking for may not be complete. If not, then I want one person on your team to be the client's, Tom, proxy. And determine just what they would think Tom would want from his application.

This proxy may have to be creative to possible guess what Tom would want and communicate that to the team that will create this application. 

## Overview 

Honest Tom has a used car lot. Tom, who owns the lot, is an active manager of the lot. He has two salespeople working for him, Jane and Jim. And there is one mechanic, Alice, working for Tom.

Tom would like to be able to see just what cars are on the lot at the moment. And he'd like to see how much he could profit if he sold all the available cars on the lot today at the current sticker price.

Tom knows what cars he has bought, what he's paid for each car and what the sticker price is for each car on the lot. 

Tom's lot has two types of cars, foreign and domestic. Jane sells the domestic cars and Jim sells the foreign cars. Each of them, Jane and Jim, should be able to view how much they could make if they sold all their cars. Both Jane and Jim recieve a 23 percent commission and also know the wholesale, amount Tom paid for the car, and retail, sticker price of the cars they are responsible for.

There usually are some cars in for repair. Alice can get pretty busy at times. And Tom, Jim and Jane need to know what cars are in for repair so they can exclude these cars from the above calculations.


What I'd like you to do is to create a set of User Stories that could be used to build an application that could be used for Tom's lot. 

It would allow the Lot Manager, Salespeople and mechanic to work together to find out how much they could make if a miracle happened and they sold all availble cars at the current retail or sticker price.

*Remember, many details could be left out from the above. So I want one person on your team to act as the product owner. They will determine exactly what information you'll need to move forward.*

## Deliverables

1. User Stories
2. Domain Model
3. Software Application. *(maybe, if enough time)*

## Agile Process

1. Find User Roles or Personas.
2. Find Epics.
3. Break Epics into User Stories.
4. Create Design  
	4.1 Domain or Data Models.  
5. Add User Stories to a Iteration.
	1. Determine Priority.
	2. Determine Dependencies between Stories
5. Write Software guided by User Stories.
