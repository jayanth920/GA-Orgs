# Ember Object Study

One common reason to use a front-end framework is its interactivity - your
application can provide functionality to the user without needing to hit your
back-end. Often, you will want what the user sees to be updated in real time,
or some other kind of value binding (linking property A to property B so that
if A is changed, B gets updated too). Ember provides a way to implement value
binding in applications through a construction called an Ember Object.

## Prerequisites

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

- Read values from an Ember Object using `.get()`
- Write values to an Ember Object using `.set()`
- Explain the benefit of using Ember computed properties
- Create Ember computed properties
