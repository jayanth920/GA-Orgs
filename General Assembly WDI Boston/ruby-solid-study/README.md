# Ruby SOLID Study

This study introduces you to design principles in Ruby. Design principles are
rules-of-thumb that help you make decisions about how to structure your code and
design your classes. Good design helps manage complexity, makes code resilient
to changing requirements, and makes it less expensive to change.

## Prerequisites

- [Ruby Object](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/ruby-object)

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

- Recall each principle in the abbreviation SOLID
- Recognize "code smells" that suggest refactorings toward SOLID design
- Refactor code using design heuristics

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.
1. Create and checkout a new branch, named `response`.
1. Follow the directions given in [`study.md`](study.md).
1. When finished, push to your fork and submit a pull request.
