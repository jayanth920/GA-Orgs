# The ColorMaster #

This assignment will test, and help you better understand, the flow of control in Bash and Git.

## Important Note ##

Whenever you finish a logical chunk of work, make a Git commit with a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html). You should have at least one commit per challenge, if not one commit per step! Get in the habit of making good descriptive commits now, and it will save you countless headaches down the road. 

## Some Background ##

You are the ColorMaster. You know your colors better than anybody else in the world... which is how you came to be the ColorMaster to begin with... which has only improved your mastery of colors. You're basically the Gandalf of colors is what we're saying. Anyway, as the ColorMaster it's your job to keep the colors straight! You've been camping in Alaska for the past nine months, far, far away from your directories, and while you were been gone, someone has wreaked havoc on your filesystem. Colors have been de-sorted, mis-sorted, and entire directories are missing! It's a massacre! Luckily, you can fix this.

## Instructions ##

1. Fork this repo.
2. Clone your newly forked repo to your local machine (from whatever folder you store your code in).
3. Change into this newly cloned directory.
4. Change into the `colors` directory. Now to repair the damage:
5. **Challenge 1: Fix Up Your Items (Modifying Files)**

    In each of the folders named after a color (ex. `purple`) there are some files. Somebody has mischeviously erased the descriptions of each object! Change into each color directory and open each file to fill in the names of each object (all in lowercase).

    a. Fill in the blank in `plum.txt` in the `purple` directory

    b. Fill in the blank in `tree.txt` in the `green` directory

6. **Challenge 2: Add Your Souvenirs from Alaska (Creating Directories and Files)**

    Follow the directions for each of the tasks below

    a. Create a `yellow` directory

    b. In your `purple` directory, create a file called `grape.txt` and insert the following text into it:

        I'm a grape!

    b. In your `red` directory, create a file called `firetruck.txt` and insert this firetruck into it:

         _,..=xxxxxxxxxxxx,
        /L_Y.-"""""""""`,--n.
        .--'[=======]|L]J: []\
        |/ _ ''_ " " ||[ -_ 4 |
        '-(_)-(_)----'v'-(_)--'

        I'm a firetruck!

7. **Challenge 3: Organize Your Items (Moving Files Around)**

    a. Change into your unsorted directory. Inside, you'll see a few items that have been removed from their folders. Go ahead and move them into their correct folders.

    Hint: Remember the command to list all of the files in a directory? Maybe whoever did this added a `.` before a file to hide it in the unsorted folder.

    b. Once you've finished with the above task, take a look in the red folder at `apple.txt`. Your ColorMaster eyes notice that this is no red apple, it's GREEN! Move it to the correct folder.

8. **Challenge 4: Take Out The Trash (Removing Files)**

    a. Remove the now-empty `unsorted` folder. Than nasty vandal must have brought it with him to ruin your work!

    b. As you gaze upon your glorious work, colors gleaming under the blueish light of your computer screen at 4:00 in the morning, you notice some intruders. A few homeless `.html` files are lurking in the filesystem; the vandal must have littered them there. Use your knowledge of the command line to get rid of them.

    Hint: If you remember, there is a way to remove multiple .html files from a folder at once.

9. Now that you've cleaned everything up, make a final commit and push your work up to your GitHub account.

10. Make a pull request against the repo owned by the head of the ColorMaster OrderÂ® to show him the fine work you have done.
