# Django Practice

## Building the Cafeteria App

This practice is split up into three parts: v1, v2, and v3.

### V1: CRUD

Follow the guidelines in [`docs/v1.md`](docs/v1.md) to complete CRUD on an
`Ingredient` resource for the cafeteria app.

**When you are done, commit your work with the title "Version 1 Complete" and a
full description of your work.**

### V2: One-to-Many

Follow the guidelines in [`docs/v2.md`](docs/v2.md) to add a new CRUD-able
`Recipe` resource that has a one-to-many relationship to the `Ingredient`
resource.

**When you are done, commit your work with the title "Version 2 Complete" and a
full description of your work.**

### V3: Many-to-Many

Follow the guidelines in [`docs/v3.md`](docs/v3.md) to add CRUD-able
`RecipeIngredient` resource that acts as a "through table" between `Recipe` and
`Ingredient` to create a many-to-many relationship.

**When you are done, commit your work with the title "Version 3 Complete" and a
full description of your work.**
