# RSpec Apartments

Refer to the [apartments lab](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/wdi_1_ruby_lab_apartments) for this assignment. Starting from scratch (try not to copy-paste anything from your previous work, though you can certainly refer to it), build *only* the `Tenant` and `Apartment` classes using Test-Driven Development with RSpec. The bonuses and the `Building` class are optional, but if you attempt them, be sure to test-drive them.
