# Pair Programming Study

What is Pair Programming? Wikipedia says:

> Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two
> programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code
> while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it
> is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

> While reviewing, the observer also considers the "strategic" direction of the
> work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to
> address. This is intended to free the driver to focus all of their attention
> on the "tactical" aspects of completing the current task, using the observer
> as a safety net and guide.
