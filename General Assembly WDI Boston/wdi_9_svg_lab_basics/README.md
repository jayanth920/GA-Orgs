# SVG Basics

**[SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG)** (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based vector image format supported by all modern browsers. By the end of this exercise, you should feel comfortable creating basic static charts and graphs with SVG.

## Why SVG over images?

* SVG can be created using any text editor
* SVG can be zoomed, scaled, indexed, scripted, and compressed
* SVG can be printed with high quality at any resolution
* SVG files are just XML, and thus easily manipulated by numerous libraries
