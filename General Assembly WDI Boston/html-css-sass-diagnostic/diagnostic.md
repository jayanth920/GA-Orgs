# Sass Diagnostic

Place your responses inside the fenced code-blocks where indicated by comments.

## Sass Variables

We have a color literal, `#6495ed`, that we want to store in the variable named
"cornflower". Write the Sass code necessary to assign the color literal to the
desired name.

```scss
// your response here
```

Write the Sass code to access the variable once it has been defined.

```scss
a {
  color: /* your response here*/;
}
```

## File Structure

How can you add multiple modules to a style manifest?

```md
<!-- Your response here -->
```

## Arithmetic

Suppose you have a variable defined, `$base-font-size`, that sets the font-size
on the body element. Use that variable to increase font-size of `h1`
elements by 30%.

```scss
// your response here
```

Now, suppose you have a `$base-margin` defined as below. Write a style rule to
**halve** the base margin, but only for list item elements.

```scss
$base-margin: 1.5em;
```

```scss
// your response here
```

## Best Practices

What are two best practices when working with Sass?
