print(the_answer)
```

What would be the output from the log?

```py
# your answer here
```

## Flow Control and Functions

### Question 8

In the below code block:

1. Create a function `add_together` that accepts two parameters, `first` and `second` and prints the result from combining them with the `+` operator.
2. Invoke the function by sending it **ordered arguments**
3. Invoke the function by sending it **named arguments**

```py

```

### Question 9

Take a look at the following JavaScript:

```js
const data = {
  scores: [10, 13, 8, 3, 20, 0]
}
const printOddsOrEvens = function (arr) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] === 0) {
      console.log('There\'s nothing here')
    } else if (nums[i] / 2 === 0) {
      console.log(`${nums[i]} is even`)
    } else  {
      console.log(`${nums[i]} is odd`)
    }
  }
}
printOddsOrEvens(data.scores)
```

Convert the above JavaScript code into it's Python equivalent:

```py

```
