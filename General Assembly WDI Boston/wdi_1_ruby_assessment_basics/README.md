# Ruby Assessment - Day 2

Fork this repository, and clone the fork to your local computer. Edit this README.md file to contain the answers, and then make a pull request on Github to turn in the assessment. 

## Question 1

```ruby
a = 5
b = 4
a = b
```

At the end of this program, what are the values of a and b? Try to explain, in plain English, how you got your answer for each one. 

## Question 2

```ruby
e = 3
f = 9
g = e + f
f == g
e = 3
```

At the end of this program, what are the values of e, f, and g? Try to explain, in plain English, how you got your answer for each one. 

## Question 3

```ruby
weather = "cloudy"
weather == "cloudy" 
```

What is the difference between these two statements? Explain your answer. 

## Question 4

```ruby
x = 2

if x == 3
  puts "sushi is tasty"
elsif x > 0
  puts "sushi is delicious"
end
```

Imagine that you take the code from this question, save it to a file called `sushi.rb`, and run `ruby sushi.rb` in your Terminal. 

What would be the output? Explain your answer. 

## Question 5

```ruby
food = "walnut"

if food == "walnut"
  puts "I'm allergic!"
