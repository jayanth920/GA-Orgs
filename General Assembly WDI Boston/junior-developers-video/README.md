### I need to master it all
- Don't chase shiny objects
- Master of none
- Stop tool/software shaming
- Use new tools when it solves a problem you have
  
### I need to memorize everything
- Don't waste time on information that can be looked up
- This is not a test
- Know how to use resources wisely
- Use documentation and google
- Your peers are your resource
- Be comfortable admitting what you don't know
    
### I need to write perfect code
- Just try it
- The computer doesn't judge you   
- You can always try again
- Show your code early and often
- It'll be pretty when we get there, not along the way
    
### I need to code all the time
- Have a life outside code
- Productivity goes down after over work
- Contribute to the world, not just tech community
