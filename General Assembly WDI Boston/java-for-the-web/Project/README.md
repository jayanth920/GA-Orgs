# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project: Fullstack Java Web Application 
## Overview

A client has outlined a need for a new full-stack app
You will design, develop, and architect a full-stack app with Spring Boot and Spring Framework.

Their existing service is a financial dashboard that is incredibly slow and needs a `microservice` makeover. Take the existing back-end application code and break out one of the services to be a microservice.

# Requirements

## Your proposal must include (using this template):
- A clear problem statement from the client
- What business problem are you trying to solve with technology?
- Clearly present technical requirements of solving the business problem
- A solution for a monolithic existing service service
- Explain how to breakdown the monolithic service
- How to make the monolithic service scalable
- The pros/cons of implementing a monolithic problem
- How the microservice will solve the companies problems
- Include an external case study that demonstrates a similar problem/solution

## Some examples of how companies ended up with microservices:

- http://philcalcado.com/2015/09/08/how_we_ended_up_with_microservices.html

***Requirements***

## Your App must:

- Be Bootstrapped with Spring Boot and Docker Compose
- Use `React` for the front-end
- Manage database creation and migrations with FlyWheel
- Have at least two endpoints that query one table each
- Have commented code
- Adhere to the provided [style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) for writing your Java

### Architecture
- Run Spring Boot in a Docker container / containerize your application

# Bonuses

### Testing
- Use agile methodologies for TDD
- Implement TDD for a scope of work
-  Given a class, add conditional methods to a test case
-  Have tests for each endpoint that test for functionality, status codes, and error handling:
- Invalid params/ids, missing routes

### Front-end
- Describe the use cases for UI testing
- Create and run UI tests with the Enzyme framework
- Write and run a jUnit test for each feature
- Test your app for accessibility
