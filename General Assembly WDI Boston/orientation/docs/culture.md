# Workspace Culture

Break into groups of three or four. In your group, discuss and outline your
expectations of each other as colleagues. Then, we'll share what each group has
discussed and record a social contract.

Most groups of developers come up with something like the following:

- Respect is mutually given, not earned
- Be an open communicator: do not disengage when working in a group, and
  practice active listening.
- Be open to constructive feedback: when giving feedback, be specific.
- Take others' intent into account
- Be collaborative, share freely, and respect others' abilities and
  preferences.
- Maintain a growth mindset and a good attitude.
- Ask lots of questions, but do your due diligence!
- Leave outside stress and your ego at the door.
- Foster a space where it is safe to fail and learn from mistakes.
- Have fun!

The class Culture Code will be permanently visible throughout the program
so that it can be a constant reminder for us.

## Words of Wisdom

1. Be methodical. Take baby steps.
1. Don't worry about knowing *everything* - focus on knowing what you need to know **right now**.
1. Focus on getting the thing working, not being perfect.
1. Keep a **growth** mindset.
1. Be okay with failure.
1. Don't be afraid to try new things.
1. Don't be afraid to break something! Breaking things and putting them back together is a great way to learn how something works.
1. Read your error message.
1. Read your error message *again*.

1. Now, read the error *outloud*!
1. Practice good, meaningful naming.
1. It's okay if you need to re-name something later.
1. Don't code blindly. Take small steps, keep an open mind, search the web, and ask yourself: *why am I doing it this way?*
1. Always make sure to do gut checks: Restart (your server). Refresh (your browser). Retry (doing the thing).
