### Late arrivals and Early departures

- If you arrive after **9:15 am** you are officially tardy. Any training missed is your
  responsibility to make up.
  - **Note:** We take attendance at **9:00am.** If you arrive between 9:00am and
  9:15am, you are late.
- If you are not present at the beginning of afternoon announcements, or if you
  leave before **4:50 pm**, you will accrue one early departure.
- 3 tardies/left early = 1 absence
- If you are late between 9-9:15am or when coming back from breaks **5 times**,
  you may not successfully complete the program. 
- If you arrive late, you will have already been marked absent and must check in
  with an instructor when you arrive to be marked tardy instead.

### Absences

- If you miss more than **3** days regardless of reason, you will not
  successfully complete the program.
- If you know of a planned absence(s), please contact an instructor ASAP.

### Inclement Weather Policy

- GA and 125 Summer Street building follow the City of Boston weather advisory
  notice for closing due to weather.
- GA will notify staff and students via slack when the building is closed due to
  weather.
- Plan your commute accordingly, a delayed train or traffic is not an excuse to
  be late.
