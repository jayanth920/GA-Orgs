## Growth Mindset

First and foremost, to be successful in this program, it is **imperative** that
you understand what a **_Growth Mindset_** is and have one!

**_Please Note:_** The goal of the program is not to produce working code,
working code is a by-product of the goal.
**The goal of the program is to _learn how to create_ working code.**

## Professionalism

- We will treat you like adults and expect you to behave like adults.
- Disagreements with other students should be resolved on your own.
- As with every rule, there are exceptions. If any student is behaving in a
  way that is disrespectful and/or dangerous towards their fellow developers,
  that should be brought to student experience's attention immediately.
  Similarly, any issues that involve an instructor should be brought to student
  experience's attention immediately.
- Please see the 'Code of Conduct' portion of your student enrollment
  agreement if you have questions about this.

### Slack

We communicate here at GA using a popular chat platform called
[Slack](https://slack.com). You should have already been invited to Slack and
added to the relevant channels. If you have not, please reach out to an
instructor or the student experience team ASAP.

There are several channels we use to organize communication while at GA. These
channels have specific purposes, and should be used properly. The following
table outlines the channels we use, and how we use them. The use of `< cohort >`
is a placeholder for the cohort number. For example, `sei-bos-< cohort >-forum`
might be `sei-bos-04-forum`.

| Channel |  Purpose   |
|:--------|:-----------------:|
| sei-bos-< cohort >-forum | Instructors will send out important messages and post morning/evening exercises and lesson links. |
| sei-bos-< cohort >-outcomes | Where the outcomes team will post relevant information on workshops, homework reminders, and more. |
| sei-bos-< cohort >-code | The place for code snippets both from instructors and peers.  |
| sei-bos-< cohort >-projects | The place for questions related to projects as well as links to issues or completed projects for testing or sharing. |
| sei-bos-< cohort >-parking-lot | The place for asking questions, debugging, and any other issues that come up during class |
| sei-bos-< cohort >-fun | The place for **fun**, like memes and planning social activities. |

#### Slack-spectations

Slack is an extension of General Assembly. Although it's online, we continue to
have professionalism standards and expectations for its use, just as a company
might for any online communication while on the job.

One of the most popular channels for developers during the immersive is the
`-fun` channel, the one all about fun! This is where the memes and jokes get to
live, but that means that we need to have some rules about what to consider when
making these posts.

General Assembly is not only a working environment, but also a *learning environment.*
We need to be extra cognizant of creating a **safe and inclusive** space so that
everyone is able to learn and grow, both as developers and as people. Part of
that means ensuring that we think twice, or even thrice, when posting jokes or
memes. This especially applies to memes that use women, LGBTQ folks, or
POC (people of color) as a punchline. The tech industry is notoriously white,
male, straight, and cis-gender. Part of having an inclusive space means ensuring
that **everyone** feels comfortable, not just those who dominate the industry.

If any faculty member notices an inappropriate post on Slack, they will remove
it and message the poster directly to discuss why it does not adhere to General
Assembly's Slack professionalism standards. Remember, making mistakes is human,
but we want to be sure every developer at General Assembly is prepared to be a
professional and inclusive contributor to the development community.

Consider these memes as examples of inappropriate posts here at General Assembly:

| # |   Example Meme  |
|:--------|:-----------------:|
| 1: | <img width="400" alt="cheating guy code meme" src="https://media.git.generalassemb.ly/user/3667/files/5dc93580-dec2-11e9-8648-96fd2c8a75bf"> |
| 2:  | <img width="400" alt="html how to meet ladies meme" src="https://media.git.generalassemb.ly/user/3667/files/71749c00-dec2-11e9-8d5b-2358718d21f2">  |

Both could be considered funny and appropriate in certain settings, but they
also both contain references that could very likely make certain people
uncomfortable. The first is a very popular meme format that depicts a man
objectifying (and cheating) on women. The second one makes sense in the context
of the show (the character isn't likable, and wearing this shirt shows that he's
misogynist and embodies the tech-bro persona), but it isn't appropriate in a
professional setting due to it's overall message and because that context isn't
available with just the picture.

**Bottom Line:** Consider how context (or lack-thereof) might inform someone's
interpretation of a joke or meme. Think twice and put in the work to make
General Assembly inclusive and safe for all learners.

## Independence

- We will do our best to train you with everything we can in the time we have.
  However, the ultimate responsibility for what you learn lies with **YOU**.
- Self learning is a skill that must be practiced.  You will be asked to learn
  independently, in teams, and as a class.  Just as you would on the job.
- If you're having trouble with material, ask questions. Reach out to
  instructors in person or on slack for help. Find extra tutorials online.
- If you're ahead, ask for more work!
