## Alumni Panel

Let's be honest, deciding to make the life changing decision to enroll in this
full-time immersive program, most likely came with some questions and possible
doubt. This portion of orientation will give you the opportunity to hear from
alumni from past Software Engineering Immersive programs. You can expect to hear:

- Names of each alumni panelist and what they were doing before SEI.
- What the alumni do now after successfully completing the program.
- What their experience was like in SEI.
- What some of the challenges were that they faced during their cohorts.
- What was something they wish they knew at the start of the program.
- Open the floor up for questions.

Example questions to ask:

- What do you wish someone had told you? Would you have believed it?
- How long was the gap in time between learning something and feeling
  comfortable using it?
- What is your learning process on-the-job?
- How important were the projects for your learning and comfort?
- What was it like day-to-day and week-to-week during the program?
- How did you convince someone that you can do the job even though you
  don't have experience?
- What was your highest level of education? Did your degree matter?

## Consultant Q&A

You just heard from various SEI alumni, now is your opportunity
to ask the Consultant team questions you'd like answered. From each
Consultant, you can expect to hear:

- More about their background and journey.
- How they began their careers in software engineering.
- The biggest challenge they had in starting their careers.
- Projects they've worked on.

Here are some example questions you should ask:

- What do you believe the key to success is in this program?
- What is your personality and communication style?
- How do I keep a positive attitude when things seem impossible?
- Any words of wisdom before we begin this journey?
