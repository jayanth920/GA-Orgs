# ga-wdi-boston/meta

Knowledge base and forum for
[WDI](https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive) in Boston

## Wiki

Instructors contribute to the wiki to support expanding institutional knowledge.
If you're a student and you have a suggestion, see [Issues](#issues) below.

-   Document procedures or instructions in one place instead of copying them
    into individual lessons, labs, and assessments.
-   Document expectations and class policies.
-   Document common FAQs by topic.

## Issues

Just as we use the Issues feature of individual lesson repos to report problems
or concerns with material, feel free to use the Issues feature on this
repository to start discussions about anything related to the course.

These discussions will typically be among instructors teaching WDI in Boston,
but students are welcome to participate in discussions as well. Some
suggestions:

-   Discuss changes specific to future iterations of WDI in Boston.
-   Communicate suggestions with instructors.

Do you want to suggest an FAQ or anything else to go in the
[wiki](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki)? Start by adding an issue
with your suggestion.
