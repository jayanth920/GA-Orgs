## REFLECTION
# reflection is the ability of a computer program to examine (see type introspection)
# and modify the structure and behavior (specifically the values, meta-data, properties and functions) of the program at runtime.


# Uses:
# Reflection is often used as part of software testing, such as for the runtime creation/instantiation of mock objects.
# Reflection is also a key strategy for metaprogramming.

class Foo
  def hello
  end
