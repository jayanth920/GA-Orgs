# Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of specific steps and logic needed to accomplish a task.

Sometimes there are better (more efficient) ways to complete a task. Sometimes, we don't actually care about the answer being the 'best', but just close as figuring out the perfect answer might take too long.

## Exercise: How to put on a shirt

Write explicit steps describing how someone will put on a t-shirt.

In a few minutes, a few people will try to follow your instructions and we'll see what happens.

## Search

### Binary Search

1. Let min = 1 and max = n.
1. Guess the average of max and min, rounded down (so that it is an integer).
1. If you guessed the number, stop. You found it!
1. If the guess was too low, set min to be one larger than the guess.
1. If the guess was too high, set max to be one smaller than the guess.
1. Go back to step 2.

## Commons sorts

Sorting is common task that we use algorithms to accomplish. The goal is to take a collection (frequently an array) and arrange its elements in ascending order. There are dozens of ways to do this, but we'll look at just three.

### Bubble Sort

### Insertion Sort

### Quick Sort

### Merge Sort
