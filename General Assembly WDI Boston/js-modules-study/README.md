# Study: Modules in Node and JavaScript

## Prerequisites

- None.

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

- Read and evaluate code that uses IIFEs.
- Draw inferences about how Node isolates modules.
- Explain the advantages of having modular code.
- Write an inline module.
- Write a module that is exported to another file.

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.
1. Create and checkout a new branch, named `response`.
1. Follow the directions given in [`study.md`](study.md).
1. When finished, push to your fork and submit a pull request.

Your pull request description should contain a "fist to five" for comfort and
clarity. Additionally, you should mention the resources you used to help you
complete this diagnostic. For example:

```md
Comfort: 3
Clarity: 3

I used Google and my class notes to help with this exercise.

You may wish to refer to [FAQs](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/)
related to [forking,
cloning](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone), and
[pull
requests](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/PullRequest).

You may use **any resource** other than each other to complete this exercise.
This includes referencing talk materials, appropriate documentation, and
searching for help online.

You should be running `grunt nag` before diagnosing any bugs, since it finds
some of the most common sources of errors. After `grunt nag` passes, you should
run `grunt test` to run the included tests. Tests will tell you whether of not
your responses are correct.
