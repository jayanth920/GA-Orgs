'use strict'

// code to your heart's content
// your goal is to have something at the end to show for it
// rough goal: an object with a property containing a function
// once you've got it, assign it to `module.exports` at the
// bottom of the file
//
// if you're strapped for ideas, try re-writing cipher or randomizer code

// exporting
// there are two ways to export:

// exports.property = value;

// and

// module.exports = {
//   property1 : value1,
//   property2 : value2
// };

// the former is good for building an object one property at a time
// the latter is good for when you've already got an object or want
// to export just one thing

// here is what NOT to do:
//
// exports = { ... };

// this overwrites `exports` with a new object. fine, right?
//
// well, no. `module.exports` and `exports` are aliases starting out
// but if you do this, `exports` will point to a new object,
// while `module.exports` still points to the old one
//
// you'll lose hours of your life trying to track this bug down!
