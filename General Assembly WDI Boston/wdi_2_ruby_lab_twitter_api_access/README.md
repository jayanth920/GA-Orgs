# Twitter Lab

Using the Twitter API, create a JSON API that through params will allow users to show information from Twitter. 

- Recent Tweets
- Tweets about a specific topic/search term
- Details about a user
- Trending topics

And then display the information accordingly on screen. 

*Ensure that you do not check your credentials into Git*

### Hints: 

Use dotenv and a .gitignore to keep the user credentials out of version control (git).
Use a Gemfile to manage gem dependencies.
Use Pry to inspect tweets and other objects.
