# SQL-NoSQL Differences Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

One of the most highly debated topics in software engineering is over which type of database reigns supreme: SQL (relational) or NoSQL (non-relational). There are [plenty](https://vshn.ch/en/blog/nosql-why-you-should-use-mongodb-instead-of-a-relational-database/) of [opinionated](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/) blog posts on the subject, but we're going to take a look at a few that weigh the pros and cons of each.

_**Note:** You do not have to read about the different types of SQL and NoSQL. We will use PostgreSQL and MongoDB in this course._
