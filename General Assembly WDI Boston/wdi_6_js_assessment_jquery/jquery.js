// Refer to jquery.html to answer these questions (but do not modify it).

$(document).ready(function(){
  ///// Question 1
  // Add the class "highlighted" to all quotes (<q> elements) within articles.

  ///// Question 2
  // Make the "Toggle Articles" link hide or show the content, and only the
  // content, of all articles.

  ///// Question 3
  // Make the "close" links in the alerts at the top of the page remove the
  // corresponding alert from the page entirely (don't just hide it).

  ///// Question 4
  // Make the comment form functional: Typing something into the input and
  // pressing Enter or clicking the Comment button should add a new list item to
  // the list of comments, containing that text.

  ///// Question 5
  // Make it so clicking on a comment list item toggles the class "favorite" on
  // it, including comments that were added after the page loaded.
