# JS Practice

Use your previous lessons, studies, favorite search engine and the provided
readings to research and respond to the following questions.

## Fizzbuzz

1. Fizzbuzz
    - Create a file in this `js-practice` repo in the `bin` folder and name it `bin/fizzbuzz.js`
    - Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.
    - For each multiple of 3, print “Fizz” instead of the number.
    - For each multiple of 5, print “Buzz” instead of the number.
    - For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz”
    instead of the number.

2. [99 Bottles](http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/lyrics.html)
    - Create a file in this `js-practice` repo in the `bin` folder and name it `bin/99bottles.js`
    - Running the program should print the lyrics of the song, be efficient
    and use loops/if statements

3. [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors)
    - Create a file in this `js-practice` repo in the `bin` folder and name it `bin/rps.js`
    - Write a script that looks at a variable representing either rock, paper,
      or scissors, and picks a random one to pit it against.
    - Log "Computer picked: <rock/paper/scissors>. You <win/lose>".
    - _**Hint:** Try using Numbers to relate to user choices like using 0 to refer
    to rock, 1 for paper, and 2 for scissors. Javascript includes a `random`
    method within the `Math` built-in object to help you generate these numbers._

4. Dice Roller
    - Create a file in this `js-practice` repo in the `bin` folder and name it `bin/die.js`
    - Write a script that chooses two random numbers (1-6) and prints them to
    the console. It should also print the sum
    - BONUS: have your script take an argument of the # of dice to be rolled.
    i.e. if I run `node bin/dice-roller.js 5` it should roll 5 dice, print
    each dice result, and the sum. [_**Click for a Hint**_](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+pass+arguments+to+a+node+script)
