# Stretch Goals

Once (and only once) you've satisfied project requirements and met MVP,
here are some additional goals that you can shoot for:

- Implement user roles and permissions as an [Access Control List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list)
- Utilize a third party API with search functionality and cache results http://apis.io/
- Utilize a new third party python package.
- Utilize an email API like [sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/) or [mailchimp](https://www.mailchimp.com)
- Utilize a text API like [twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)
