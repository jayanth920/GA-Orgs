# Tips

You **should**:

-   **Don’t get too caught up in too many awesome features** – simple is always
    better. Build something impressive that does one thing well.
-   **Design first.** Planning with user stories and wireframes before writing
    code means you won't get distracted changing your mind – you'll know what to
    build, and you can spend your time wisely by just building it.
-   **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
-   **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use**.
-   **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the
    logic of something helps.
-   **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful**.
-   **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because
    you can always go back in time to a previous version.
-   **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories
    focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
-   **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your
    naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at
    your app and understand what everything is?
-   **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find
    the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
-   **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each
    block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what and why means
    someone else can pick it up and get it.

**Good luck and happy hacking!**
