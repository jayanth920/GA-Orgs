## Real World Examples

Real world examples can help the ideas stick.

Examples:

- API's are a glorified Facade pattern
- `withRouter` appears to use Decorator pattern

## Recursion

The movie "Inception" is a great example of recursion! The main characters are attempting to plant an idea during someone else's dream. If they're unable to do it at the current level, they dream a level deeper and try again. This continues until they're successful, at which point they have to wake up from each level of dreaming to fully get out of the dream sequence.
