# Ember Starter: Using Ember 2.0

## Foundations
At this point, students have already learned how to:

- Create an Ember 1.13.13 application.

## Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:

- Create an Ember 2.0 application, starting with an Ember 1.13.13 application.
- Create an Ember 2.0 application by using this repo as a starting point.
- Configure an Ember application to use the pods file structure.

## Upgrade to Ember 2

### Checklist

- [ ] Create a new Ember application using `ember-cli`.
- [ ] Edit dependency manifests (`package.json` and `bower.json`) to use Ember 2.
- [ ] Update dependencies. (`npm install && bower install`)
- [ ] Start server. (`ember serve`)
- [ ] Verify that the browser is loading Ember 2 by opening the web inspector.

### Install

 ```
 npm install && bower install
 ```


## Using Pods

We'll use pods instead of the traditional MVC file structure. The reason for this is twofold:

1. Pods structure better emulates thinking in components, where we "separate concerns, not technologies".
1. UI programming is fundamentally different than backend programming. It helps to emphasize that difference by using a file structure that more closely maps to parts of the UI.

### The Difference

Suppose we had a taqueria. If we had a resource for our different menu items, it might look like this with a traditional MVC file structure:

```
app/controllers/taco.js
app/routes/taco.js
app/models/taco.js
app/templates/taco.hbs
```

With a pod-based naming convention, the files would be located at:

```
app/taco/controller.js
app/taco/route.js
app/taco/model.js
app/taco/template.hbs
```

Here's the mapping:

```diff
- app/controllers/taco.js
+ app/taco/controller.js

- app/routes/taco.js
+ app/taco/route.js

- app/models/taco.js
+ app/taco/model.js

- app/templates/taco.hbs
+ app/taco/template.hbs
```

### Activating Pods

     Setting `disableAnalytics` to true will prevent any data from being sent.
   */
-  "disableAnalytics": false
+  "disableAnalytics": false,
+  "usePods": true
 }
```

Now, if you use `ember generate`, the `--pod` flag will be used automatically.

### Cleaning Up

Remove the following directories from your project so you aren't tempted to stray from the pods structure:

- [ ] `app/controllers`
- [ ] `app/models`
- [ ] `app/routes`
- [ ] `app/templates`

Removing the last directory gets rid of the default generated application template. If you want to regenerate it, use

```
ember destroy template application # should no-op
ember generate template application
```

## Optional: Use This Repo

If you'd rather not complete these steps manually, you can use the following instructions to use this repository as a basis of your own Ember 2 with PodsÂ® application.

### Checklist

- [ ] Navigate to your project directory.
- [ ] `git clone git@github.com:ga-wdi-boston/ember-starter.git my-app-name`
- [ ] Make our solution branch your master branch. (see below)
- [ ] `npm install && bower install`
- [ ] `git remote remove origin`
- [ ] Create your own remote (on GitHub) and add it as origin.

### Branch Shuffle

Once you've cloned the starter repo, you'll want to use the `solution` branch as the basis for your Ember application, but you won't want to work on `solution`.

After you change into the project directory:

- [ ] Switch to the `solution` branch. (`git checkout solution`)
- [ ] Delete the `master` branch. (`git branch -d master`)
- [ ] Rename the `solution` branch to `master`. (`git branch -m master`)
