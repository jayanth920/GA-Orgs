## Lab 1 ##

# Use `Array.new` to create a Ruby Array with ten elements
# where elements are equal to their index multiplied by 2.
# Store the result and display it on the console with `p <array name>`

## Lab 2 ##

# Assign `20` to the element at `length+1`.

# Access the 3rd element from the end of an array length of 5.

# Access element 9 for a length of 5 elements.

# Assign `[-12, -49]` to the 5th element from the end.

# Access all the elements starting at index 1.
