## New(er) Ruby Frameworks

BTW, thought I'd throw in a reference to some newer Ruby Web frameworks. Every couple of years a couple of Rails alternatives pop up. At one point there was a framework named "MErb". It was gaining popularity until the creator Yehuda Katz, also one of the creators of Ember, and the Rails core team decided to merge Rails and Merb. This happened in Rails 3.0.

Another popular long lasting framework is [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/). I view Sinatra as a "lightweight Rails". It has a smaller code base and smaller feature set. It is easier to wrap one's head around. But, it's limited and, like most technologies, the right tool for for some jobs.
