# Big O Cheatsheet

1. Time complexity - amount of time algorithm takes to run

2. Space complexity - how much memory algorithm needs to run

## Time Complexity

### O(1) Constant Time

"Big O of 1" or "O of 1" or "runs in constant time"

Takes same amount of time and space for algorithm to run, no matter the input

Example: Throwing a bag of apples into the trash takes same amount of time whether the bag has 2 or 20 apples

```js
console.log('hello world')
```

### O(n) Linear Time

as input size increases, processing time also increases linearly (one more step in code for each input)

Example: Throwing apples away 1 by 1. This will take more time depending on how many apples there are

### O(n2) Quadratic Time

**inefficient**

Example: nested loops
```js
const nestedLoopOverArray = arr => {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
            console.log(arr[i], arr[j])
        }
    }
}
```
if `arr` has 2 items, there will be 4 steps
if `arr` has 100 items, there will be 10,000 steps

### O(n^3) cubic time

**inefficient**

For an input with the size n, algorithms with cubic time complexity execute n3 times

Example:

```js
const twoNestedLoopsOverArray = arr => {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
          for (let k = 0; k < arr.length; k++) {
              console.log(arr[i], arr[j], arr[k])
          }
        }
    }
}
```

### O(log(n)) logarithmic time complexity
very efficient!

"Divide and conquer"

Example: see "Binary Search" below


### O(n log(n)) Quasilinear Time
"seemingly linear"

An O(n log(n)) algorithm must perform a divide and conquer operation O(log(n)) for every element O(n)

Example: merge sort, quick sort

### O(n!) Factorial Time
Factorial complexity, represented as O(n!), should be avoided at all costs. Hereâ€™s why.

## Searching

### Linear Search

Best case time complexity is O(1) (constant time) (e.g. if number was 1 it only takes one step to finish)

Average case complexity is O(n) (linear time) (e.g. if number was 67, it's going to take 67 steps)
```
1. Guess "1". If no,
2. Guess "2". If no,
3. Guess "3". If no,
...
100.  Guess "100". You win!
```

### Binary Search

"Divide and Conquer" algorithm (divide up the problem, conquer smaller problems)

1. Set the initial start & stop index values

start = 76, stop = 79

2. Calculate the mid-point between the start and stop index value

mid = 77

3. If the mid-point is the target element, return the mid-point and you're done.

4. Otherwise, if the midpoint is less than the target element, then the target element is in the upper half-range.

5. Otherwise, the target element is in the lower half-range.

6. Repeat steps 2-5 while the range has elements

7. If the element wasn't found in the range, return -1
