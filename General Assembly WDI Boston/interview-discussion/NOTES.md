## Mock Interviews

Try to have each developer in your group answer at least 1 question per round.

Feel free to use your own questions to evaluate coding skills. [Here are some suggestions](/docs).

The general setup:

### Go to Stations
- Teams will each go to a station

### Ask Question
- We'll put 15 mins on the clock. Interviewer will ask one person a question.

### Answer Question
- That person will answer the question to the best of their ability.
- Everyone should be paying attention, and trying to solve the problem in their head, and consider feedback during the session. No one should be speaking out
except the interviewee unless they are asked to do so (by the interviewer).

### Retrospective

#### Self Retro
At the end of the 15 minutes, the interviewee will be asked:
  - to assess how that went
  - what they thought they could improve on
  - what they thought went well
  - any other questions they might have

#### Team Retro
The interviewer will then ask "is it ok if WE give you some feedback?"
  - other 1-2 developers in the group will give feedback
interviewer will give feedback

### Second Answer
The interviewee will then get ~10 mins of a second shot, and a chance to implement some of the feedback.

Optional if the interviewee is freezing/totally stuck.  It's ok to ask the other developer(s) in the group if they'd like to assist. Sometimes this can be helpful, sometimes it can be the opposite. I usually find in most instances the frozen person needs an extra nudge and/or a discussion about why freezing and not saying anything can be worrisome.

### Rotate
Teams rotate to the next station
