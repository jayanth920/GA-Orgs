- Tell me about yourself. (Ask all developers this question.)
- How did you get into web development?
- What are some of your strengths?
- What attracted you to this company?
- How would you apply your skills to this job?
- What are your salary expectations?
- What are your long-term career goals?
- Do you have any questions for me?
