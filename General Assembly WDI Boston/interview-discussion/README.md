- Offer

### In Person Interview

- Discussion
- Code Review
- Whiteboarding
- Actual Coding

#### Whiteboarding

- Communication and Collaboration Skills
- Job-Specific Knowledge
- Managing Pressure
- Whiteboard Ability :)

##### May Not Whiteboard

- Active debate as to whether whiteboard interviews are useful
- Front end whiteboarding such as HTML/CSS doesn't make much sense
- High pressure, not all companies value that

##### Whiteboard Process
- Soft questions (normally no writing)
- Interviewer lays out a problem
- Work through the problem with the interviewer

## How to Whiteboard

1. Repeat question
2. Write question down
3. Clarify question and goal
4. Identify any knowledge gaps and ask for an explanation (math, vocabulary, etc)
5. Talk through a high level example of a solution to get feedback
6. Ask about language constraints
7. Write pseudo code, explain each line to interviewer as it is being written
8. Keep an ice box of “problems to solve”, do not fall down rabbit holes
9. Continue communicating as you solve the problem
10. Ask for feedback once you are done or have hit a wall

## More Than Technical

The technical interview is about soft skills just as much as it is about your technical skills. When you get a problem to whiteboard or demonstrate how you would go about solving, here are some things to keep in mind:

- walk through the problem with interviewer
- ask questions about the prompt
- clarify the expectations re: pseudocode vs. actual syntax
- always write down notes
- write clearly (be mindful of space)
- IT’S NOT ABOUT THE ANSWER, IT’S ABOUT COMMUNICATION
- engage interviewer
- make eye contact
- if you have multiple interviewers, make eye contact with all of them
- qualify what you are doing
- always test all assumptions
- get more out of interviewer...build the relationship
- be honest about what you don’t know!
- never claim to know anything you do not
- don’t be afraid to nerd out and show the interviewer you are passionate about this stuff

## Examples

1.  Softballs Questions:
    - What is jQuery?  Do you use it?  Why?
    - What does it mean to be a front-end developer?
    - Tell me about when you may need to use AJAX?

2.  More Specific Questions:
    - What does it mean for a website to be responsive?
    - What is CSS specificity?
    - Where would you link a JS file in your HTML?
    - What does callback mean in JS?

3.  Whiteboard Problems
    - Diagram what happens when someone enters google.com into their browser
    - Create a click event that calls a function which adds two numbers
    - Create a function that randomly chooses one item from an array of 3

4.  Advanced Whiteboard Problems
    - Ballon-o-gram
      - Draw for me on the whiteboard the design of GA home page, without revealing me any sensitive detail.
    - Math
      - You have a bowl with 200 fish in it. Of these fish 99% are not guppies.  How many fish should you remove so that 2% of what remains are guppies. Show your work.
