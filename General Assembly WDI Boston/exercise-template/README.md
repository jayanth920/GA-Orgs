# Exercise Template

Use this template to structure your READMEs for studies, practices, diagnostics,
and challenges. Change all instances of 'exercise' to the relevant exercise type,
including the [`exercise.md`](exercise.md) file name.

Remove text from this section, or use it to frame the exercise.
Good framing answers the question "Why am I learning this?".

Be sure to include a recent [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) and Markdown linter
configuration ([`.remarkrc`](.remarkrc)). Also, include an appropriate
`.gitignore`; these are usually found in specific technology templates, for
example [js-template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/js-template).

## Prerequisites

- Topics with which developers should be familiar with.
- Prerequisites are "just-in-time", so if I have a prerequisite that mentions
    Sass, I would **not** need to include CSS as a prerequisite.
- [Links to previous materials](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/example)
    are often useful. Previous materials might include talks or other exercises.

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

- Write objectives that focus on demonstrating knowledge.
- Write learning objectives that begin with an [imperative
    verb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood).
- Avoid objectives that start with "Use" or "Understand".
- Rewrite objectives that begin with "Use" by inverting sentence structure.
- End each objective with a period.

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.
1. Install any dependencies with `bundle install` or `npm install`.
1. Create and checkout a new branch, named `response`.
1. Follow the directions given in [`exercise.md`](exercise.md).
1. When finished, push to your fork and submit a pull request.

Your pull request description should contain a "fist to five" for comfort and
clarity. Additionally, you should mention the resources you used to help you
complete this diagnostic. For example:

```md
Comfort: 3
Clarity: 3

I used Google and my class notes to help with this exercise.
```

You may wish to refer to [FAQs](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/)
related to [forking,
cloning](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone), and [pull
requests](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/PullRequest).

You may use **any resource** other than each other to complete this exercise.
This includes referencing talk materials, appropriate documentation, and
searching for help online.

You should be running `grunt nag` before diagnosing any bugs, since it finds
some of the most common sources of errors. After `grunt nag` passes, you should
run `grunt test` to run the included tests. Tests will tell you whether of not
your responses are correct.

It's probably a good idea to include the above verbatim in each exercise.
Remember to edit the link to the actual exercise file (it might be stored in a
different directory or have a different extension). If tooling is not included
in this exercise, feel free to remove that bit from these instructions.

## Bonus

Bonuses are described after the requirements, if included. They should be worked
on **only after** passing requirements.

Sometimes, we ask questions that promote thinking critically about code.
