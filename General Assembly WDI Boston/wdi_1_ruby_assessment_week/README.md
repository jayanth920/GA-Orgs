# Week 1 Ruby Assessment

The purpose of this assessment is to collect all the things we've gone over this week, and see how you're doing on them. 

Please do not refer to prior assessments in the week, but otherwise feel free to use your resources. 

In the `assessment.rb` file, either leave comments to answer a question, or write code to answer a question. This file can be executed with Ruby, so do that to make sure your code works!
