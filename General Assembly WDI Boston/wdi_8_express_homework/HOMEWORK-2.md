# Homework, Night 2

(This is also included as an added file because it is the
easiest way to avoid merge conflicts when we go through the
'git pull upstream master' routine.)

## Part 2: Add routes 

Using the contacts web app and the blog-articles web app
that we have developed in class as models and references,
define and implement the necessary routes, handlers, and
other middleware to produce a complete REST API for managing
a set of movies and reviews.

At a minimum, this means five methods:
* create a movie
* retrieve all movies
* retrieve a movie by ID
* update a movie by ID
* delete a movie by ID

If you've picked up on the pattern this far, you can
probably predict what I'm going to say here!  Since the next
step is to create an API to serve HTML, make sure you
implement all these routes in the `/api` namespace.

## Part 3: Add rendering (partially)

Continue working on the movies app.  Get the scaffolding and
infrastructue in place, and try to get as far as we got in
class.
