# Ruby vs JavaScript Array Methods Study

We've learned a lot about Ruby array methods, and you may have noticed that they
are similar to many JavaScript array methods we've already used. In this study,
you will use JavaScript instead of Ruby to solve the same problems we solved in
class, and explain the similarities and differences between the two languages.

## Prerequisites

-   [ruby-array-methods](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/ruby-array-methods)

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Explain the differences between JavaScript and Ruby array iteration methods.
-   Compare and contrast functions that parse CSV files in JS and Ruby
