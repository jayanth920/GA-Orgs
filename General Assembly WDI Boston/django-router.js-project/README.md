# Django-Router.js Project

## Overview

Over the past day and half you have learned the basics of the language Python,
a web framework to build API's using Python called Django, and a simple
JavaScript router to use on the client. Now you will use both. You will create a
server similiar to the [library-api](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/library-api)
using the [django-api](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/django-api) that you did
yesterday as a template. And you will use
[router.js](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/router.js) as a template for your
client app. This project is not a requirment to pass the course, it's just a
fun thing to hack on for an afternoon!

## Technical Requirements

-   **Use Django** to build an API.
-   Include **all major CRUD functions** in a **RESTful API** for the book
    model.
-   **Consume your own API** by making a client with router.js
-   **Not** have any obvious user facing errors.
-   Layout and style your front-end with **clean and well-formatted CSS**.
-   **(OPTIONAL) Use authentication in your API** to restrict access to
    appropriate users.

## Getting Started

Eager to get moving? Here are some good resources that you might want to refer
back to.

-   **[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)**
-   **[router.js](https://github.com/tildeio/router.js/)**
-   You can copy the data/books.csv file from the data directory in this repo to
    to use in your api. e.g., from this directory
    `cp data/books.csv <path/to/your/api/data/folder>`

Some other suggestions and best practices:

-   **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
-   **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use**.
-   **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful**.
-   **Be consistent with your code style.** You're working in teams, but you're
    only making one app per team. Make sure it looks like a unified effort.
-   **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because
    you can always go back in time to a previous version.
-   **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories
    focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
-   **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your
    naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at
    your app and understand what everything is?
-   **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find
    the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
-   **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each
    block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what and why means
    someone else can pick it up and get it.
-   **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the
    logic of something helps.

**Good luck and happy hacking!**
