# Behavior Driven Development (BDD) Study 

Testing ensures your code does what you say it does. But, how do you know what to test? And more importantly, how do you know what code needs to be written in the first place?

To begin with testing, we want to have a solid foundation of why we are writing the code, which involves communicating in a language that all stakeholders can understand. BDD will help us define business rules and system requirements that translate directly into code. Next, we want to implement these user stories in code, and ensure the code does what we say it does by having adequate test coverage.

This study will introduce you to the origins of Behavior Driven Development, why it is needed, what problems it helps solve, and finally how to get started with BDD and adding tests to your applications.

## Prerequisites

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Explain what behavior driven development is.
-   Understand how BDD helps a team write effective software.
-   Compare and contract BDD and TDD (Test Driven Development).
