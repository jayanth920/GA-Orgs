# INTRO TO PSEUDOCODE

![](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/rickandmorty/images/6/6c/Rick%26Morty.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131212193615)

_Rick and Morty encounter many problems on their pan-dimensional adventures! They have to think their way out of those problems without using any Javascript..._

Learning how to solve problems is fundamental to being a developer. In order to make interesting, creative, complex apps using a variety of technologies and techniques, having strong problem-solving skills is important.

Solving problems is about developing an analytic mindset, i.e., breaking problems down into the smallest manageable chunks. This is a big part of learning to "think like a programmer."

As a developer, you can find yourself facing a "wall of complexity" that will lead to paralysis; sometimes the most difficult part is knowing where to start. Taking some time just to think about, verbalize, or diagram a problem can give you all the clues you need to proceed. Often, it's a good idea to do this BEFORE you write any actual code.

**Pseudocode** is not JavaScript, Ruby, etc. It is, however, written in *sequence*. It's the step-by-step thought process behind the code that you will eventually write. Write your pseudocode in short lines using basic grammar, as if an articulate ten-year-old is writing it. For example, here's some pseudocode for making a lasagne:

> 1. Pre-heat oven to 350 deg F.
> 2. Boil water for that crimpy pasta.
> 3. etc...

Open up a text editor and pseudocode the following problems. Try to see past any convoluted language, redundancy, or complexity to get to the core of the problem:

## EXERCISES
To be done in pairs.

#### 1. RESTAURANT TIPPIN'

Rick, Morty, Bird Person, and Squanchy are getting dinner at a restaurant. Pseudocode an application that can take the bill, split it amongst the four of them, and add a tip percentage of your choosing. For example, a bill of $40 with a 20% tip should evaluate to $12 per person (including tip).

_suggested number of steps: 2_


#### 2. EQUATOR DRIVE

How much would it cost to drive around the world at the equator, assuming the Earth is rotating at 1,000 miles per hour, and assuming gas costs $3 per gallon, and your car gets 15 miles to the gallon?

_suggested number of steps: 3_

#### 3. SARCOPHAGUS

Rick has ordered Morty to send a sarcophagus into the sun. The sarcophagus can fly for only one second before it disintegrates, and it must be set at a minimum speed. Before he can make it fly, Morty has to set the speed on the sarcophagus. Rick mentioned offhandedly, "Uh, *burp*, the sun is 0.00001581 light years away, Morty, plan accordingly." The only problem is, the speed of the sarcophagus can only be set in miles per hour.

How can Morty work out what minimum speed to set the sarcophagus to get it into the sun?
