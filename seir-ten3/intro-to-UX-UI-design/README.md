# Introduction to UX/UI & Web Design

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, developers should be able to:

- Define User Centered Design (UCD)
- Create a User Story
- Create Wireframes
- Use web design best practices

## Preface

As programmers, why should we care about design? Throughout this course and anytime you work on personal/open-source projects as a developer, you will likely be responsible for originating a design for at least one component of an application. By design, we mean overall appearance of the user interface, from layout and color scheme and font choices, as well as the overall user experience throughout your application. 

As a user, you probably already know that there are a lot of well-designed applications and websites out there, as well as many poorly-designed ones. Focusing on designing a great user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) for your application will make your app easier for users to navigate, more likely to return, and impact the bottom line for commercial products. Well-designed apps also appear more professional and give a better impression of your programming skills. 

Luckily, non-designers can begin to implement good user-centered design by understanding a few principles and practices. And who knows, maybe you'll be the next designer/developer unicorn! 

## User-Centered Design

User-Centered design is exactly what it says. It puts the user and their desired tasks and needs at the center of the product's design. The five User-Centered Design principles:

1. Consistency
2. Ease of use
3. Simple, timely and informative dialogue
4. User is in control
5. User is given direction to avoid errors

## Planning Projects with the User in Mind

One of the first steps in the project planning process with User-Centered Design should be writing User Stories.

### User Stories

User Stories define who, why, and what for what we're creating.

1. Who are the users?
2. Why are they using the product/service?
3. What are they going to do?

Be specific about your focus, and keep it simple. An example for an astronomy matching game:

**Who:** 6-12 year olds, teachers & parents, astronomy enthusiasts

**Why:** Make STEM fun and accessible while learning basic astronomy

**What:** Fun & easy to play game of concentration based on basic astronomy including stars, planets, and fun facts about space

A standard user story would be written in the following format: 

> As a **type of user**, I want **some goal** so that **some reason**. 

For the astronomy matching game example, a user story might be written as follows: "As a 6-12-year-old user, I want to play an astronomy game so that I can have fun while learning about astronomy." 

This [article](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories) is a great overview of how to write user stories in an agile environment. 

### Wireframes

Another key part of planning projects with the user in mind is Wireframing. Wireframes are a high-level representation of a website framework. They are used to depict the layout, navigation, relationship and content hierarchy of a website used to create the user story. Having a wireframe designed before beginning to code makes your job a lot easier -- it's always better to have the destination in mind before embarking on a journey!

Wireframes are simple. They typically lack typography, color, and graphics. This keeps the focus on functionality, actions, and content hierarchy over how it looks.

They can be done online ([Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/), [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), Google Slides), using software ([Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/), [Keynote](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/keynote/id361285480), [InDesign](https://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html?sdid=KKQLR&mv=search&ef_id=EAIaIQobChMIpfPesvnd5gIVkIbACh2vOQNrEAAYASAAEgKT9_D_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!332993077121!e!!g!!indesign&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIpfPesvnd5gIVkIbACh2vOQNrEAAYASAAEgKT9_D_BwE)), or by hand.

UX Designers go even further...

Designers will then continue the design process by creating "Highfidelity Mock-Ups" which captures the look and feel of the product in the advanced stages of the design process. Hi-fi wireframes go beyond the placeholders and 'lorem ipsum' text of low-fidelity wireframes to include actual content, typefaces, colors, image dimensions, and branding elements.

Finally an interactive prototype will be created by the UX designer to show software engineers how they want the app to function.

### Key Takeaways

**User Interface (UI) Design:**
- Eliminate clutter
- Align layout edges
- Keep colors complementary, and stick with mostly neutrals plus one highlight
- Use 1-2 fonts, avoid fancy fonts, and use varying weights to differentiate text
- Don't be afraid of white space

**User Experience:**
- Make the most important user action easy to find and use
- Get feedback from real users (friends, family) on your application's UI and UX
- Be efficient with content (less is more)
- Keep headlines short, user-focused, and friendly
- Don't be afraid of imitation
