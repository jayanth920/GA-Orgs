# Web Accessibility Study

According to the 2010 census, 19% of the United States population
could be categorized as having a disability that requires accessible
technology. This could mean they use assistive technology like screen readers,
or that they simply need more guidance and clarity from the design of
web sites and web applications they use.

As developers, we have a responsibility to work to ensure as many users as
possible are able to easily use what we build. This study will explore
the types of accessibility, and how we can plan and approach developing
accessible technology.
