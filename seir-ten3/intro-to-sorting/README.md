# Intro to Sorting Algorithms

## Instructions 

1. Fork this repo to your own account and download to your `sei/exercises` folder.
1. Follow along the steps in this README to progress through the myGA modules.
1. Do not work on the CodePen/JavaScript implementation of Bubble Sort yet. We will work on that together.
1. When you are finished, submit your work with a pull request on this repo.
1. When submitting your PR, summarize your learning on this topic.


## Overview

This lesson is an introduction to the concept of sorting in computer science,
including sorting methods, stability, and how Big O comes into play for sorting.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this assignment, you will be able to:

- Define the two sorting methods and when youâ€™d use each.
- Identify whether a sort is stable or unstable, and what impact that can have.
- Explain how Big O complexity applies to sorting algorithms.

## Prerequisites

- Big O Notation

## Activity 

There are a few components to this lesson, in the following order:

1. [myGA module: Intro to Sorting Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/818) -- Start here... 
1. [myGA module: Basic Sorting Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/778) -- ... continue your studies here
2. [Exercise: Try to Write a Bubble Sort Algorithm](./bubblesort.js) -- this afternoon's coding exercise
  - To do this in class exercise, you can either...
    1. Work in the `bubblesort.js` file in this folder in VS Code on your computer
    1. Use [this codepen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/xMeqaN?editors=0010#0) provided by the myGA Basic Sorting Algorithms module, which has built-in testing
      - Note this includes insertion sort as well, but unless you finish bubble sort, don't worry about doing that section today!
