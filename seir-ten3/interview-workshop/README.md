# Interview Workshop

Let's practice our interviewing skills!

Interviewing for your first developer job can seem like a really daunting
process: it'll be different for every job and you'll have to think on your toes
a lot.

That said, it's ðŸ’¯ learnable!

Think about it like this: you are a problem solver. The process of interviewing
and getting your first developer is a problem. Approach it the same way you
would approach one of your WDI projects or a challenging lab: break it down into
smaller parts, work on each part individually, and don't let yourself get
frustrated!

This workshop will help!

### Getting the most out of this workshop

The more seriously you and your group take this, the more you will all get out
of it.

We're role playing the interview process, which will help you feel more
comfortable when you're in an actual interview. When you are acting as an
interviewer, it's best not to interject or comment on how you solve a problem.
Instead, take notes. When you are the candidate, treat your interviewers as if
they were actually interviewing you for a job and not your fellow students.

## Requirements

### [1. Whiteboarding](lib/whiteboarding.md)

The whiteboarding portion of this workshop will provide you with prompts which
each group member will answer on a white board. Your code does not have to be
perfect!

### [2. Behavioral](lib/behavioral.md)

Behavioral interview questions are commonly used as an icebreaker and to get to
know you, the candidate. Your goal is to have relatively canned answers to these
questions.

### [3. Code Challenge](lib/code-challenge.md)

Solving a code challenge in front of other people is nerve wracking at first!
That's why we're going to practice it here.

### [4. Front End](lib/front-end.md)

Can you answer these front-end trivia questions?

### [5. Back End](lib/back-end.md)

Can you answer these back-end trivia questions?
