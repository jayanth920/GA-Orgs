# Data Types Practice

This homework assignment will give you the opportunity to practice working with
the fundamentals of JavaScript covered in the prework.

## Prerequisites

- Fundamental JavaScript
- Numbers, Strings, and Booleans
- Variables
- Arrays
- Array Methods

## Instructions

1.  Fork and clone this repository.
1.  Change into the new directory and switch to a development branch.
1.  Fulfill the listed requirements.

Starter code is available in [`lib/challenge.js`](lib/challenge.js). You are
required to turn in your submission by making a pull request on the original
repository.

Unless otherwise stated, homework is due at 10 am ET the next morning. Happy coding!

**Make one commit for each prompt**

## Requirements

There are a series of prompts inside of the starter code found in
[`lib/challenge.js`](lib/challenge.js). Work through all of the prompts. Each
prompt is in the form of a JavaScript comment. Write your code to solve the
prompt _after_ the comment. Do not change any of the existing variables, as they're needed for the tests we run to grade the assignment.

Some prompts will require you to practice researching methods we did not learn
in class.

> **Tip:** Use `console.log` to test your work, but delete those statements when you
> finish working on the prompt, before moving on to the next one! Otherwise,
> you'll end up with a lot of clutter in your console and it will be hard to
> debug the prompt you're currently working on.

**You are required to make one commit after each prompt**

> **Optional:** If you're curious about whether your code passes the tests written for this assignment, you can do the following:

1. From inside this directory, run `npm install` in your terminal. This will download the testing dependencies (mocha and chai).
1. Run `npm test` in the directory. Read the output to checkout which tests your code is passing and failing.
1. If there are any errors, try fixing them and running the code again.
